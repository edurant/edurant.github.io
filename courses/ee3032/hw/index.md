* [Homework 1, due Monday of week 2 in class](hw1-w1920.pdf) [Solution](hw1-w1920sol.pdf)
* Homework 2, due Monday of week 3 in class. Be sure to support answers; for example, if you were to say that 1.24(a) is *neither* show why using at least one of a sketch, a proof, properties of products of even and odd functions, etc. 1.19(b), 1.20(a), 1.21(d), 1.23(b), 1.24(a), 1.28(b), 1.31(b). [Solution](hw2-w1920sol.pdf)
* Homework 3, due Wednesday of week 4 in class. 1.33(d), 1.35(b), 1.37(c), 1.39(a), 2.1(a,g), 2.2(b,g), 2.10(a). [Solution](hw3-w1920sol.pdf)
* Homework 4, due Monday of week 6 in class. 2.14, 2.15(b), 2.16(a), 2.22(b,f), 2.27, 2.29(c,d,f), 2.31. [Solution](hw4-w1920sol.pdf)
* Homework 5, due Monday of week 8 in class. 2.32, 2.37, 5.1(b). [Solution](hw5-w1920sol.pdf)
