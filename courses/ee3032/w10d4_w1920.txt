% Design of filter/impulse response having arbitrary transfer
% function/Fourier Transform.

f = -1000:1:1000; % frequency range of interest, H(w)=0 outside of this
w = 2*pi*f;

dt = 0.0001; % This must at least satisfy the Nyquist criterion for the highest frequency feature (800 Hz -> 1/(2*f) = 1/1600 s), but can be somewhat smaller to plot with more smoothness.
t = -0.05:dt:0.05; % Choose a range over which to calculate h(t). This is also the time over which we truncate it for analysis later.

% Set up H(w), the Fourier Transform of the impulse response = the transfer function. We make the phase 0, which
% means it has no delay and is not causal. We will modify the response later to make it physically realizable.
% This code was written to match the shape we sketched on the board.
H = ones(size(w));
H(abs(w) > 2*pi*800) = 0;
r1 = abs(f) < 200;
H(r1) = 2 - abs(f(r1))/200;

h = dw * sum(H .* exp(1j*t'*w), 2) / (2*pi); % Riemann approximation of the inverse Fourier Transform integral

h = real(h); % discard the imaginary part due to numeric roundoff
