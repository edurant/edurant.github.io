% Demonstrate how the Fourier series changes for a periodic signal as the period T0 -> infinity.
% In the limit, this will give us the Fourier transform for a non-periodic signal.
% Note that the height of the F.S. decreases as T0 rises, but the *density* stays the same.
% In class, we showed when x(t) is a rectangular pulse of height A and width tau centered at t=0, the F.S. is:
A = 4;
tau = 2;
T0 = 10; % try several values of the period, let T0 get large, -> infinity
f0 = 1/T0;
w0 = 2*pi*f0;
nmax = ceil(5*T0); n = -nmax:nmax; % Display more n's as w0->0 so that the displayed frequency range in radians/s is constant
% If you're not sure what ceil() does, type `doc ceil` to find out.
X = A*tau/T0 * sinc(n*w0*tau/2/pi); % Fourier series, /pi in MATLAB sinc
