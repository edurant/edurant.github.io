For the midterm a student should be able to...

* Demonstrate general familiarity with the syntax and operation of OpenGL
and the QGLWidget.

* Describe and use the underlying mechanisms of an event-driven graphics
system.

* Demonstrate familiarity with the transformations common to computer graphics
and to OpenGL in particular.

* Describe and implement viewing and projection transformations of 3-D scenes.

* Suggest possible debugging strategies for "Black Screen Effect".

* Describe and contrast the various illumination properties (ambient, diffuse,
specular, emissive, etc.) and their models.

* Describe the illumination models commonly applied to attenuation and transparency.

* Describe the purpose and basic algorithm of flat and Gouraud shading.

* Describe the purpose of the depth and back buffers in a graphics system.

* Describe the purpose, use and limitations of display lists and vertex
arrays.

* Describe and apply basic algorithms for in-betweening and morphing.

* Describe various models for handling animated motion (e.g., procedural,
hierarchical, and stochastic).

* Explain the mechanisms used in articulated motion and hierarchical representations.

* Describe the pitfalls associated with event scheduling (for animation)
in a modern computer and suggest strategies for minimizing their adverse
effects.

* Describe the purpose and use of texture mapping.
