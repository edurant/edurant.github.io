For the final exam a student should be able to...

* <a href="midterm.html">Meet all of the objectives for the midterm.</a>

* Describe the geometric basis for efficient collision detection.

* Explain the basics of ray tracing, including the ray tree and the basics of refractive materials.

* State how ray-object interactions are determined using methods similar to collision detection.

* Define a shadow ray and describe how it is used in ray tracing.

* Define reverse ray tracing and state a use for it.

* Define constructive solid geometry and contrast it to surface-based geometric modeling.

* State at least two anti-aliasing methods that can be used in ray tracing (or rendering of 3-D models in general).

* Apply blending to simulate transparency and related effects.

* Describe the basics of real shadows for point and non-point sources (not in w0405: including the umbra and penumbra.

* Describe the 2-pass shadow algorithm and how it uses visible surface detection methods.

* Describe the shadow volume approach to rendering shadows and state how it falls short of real shadows.

* Explain the basics of bump mapping, including why it perturbs normals without perturbing vertices.

* Discuss the basic approach of using texture maps with accumulation (or blending) to efficiently implement bump mapping.

* State the basic properties of quaternions and their use in rotations.

* (not in w0405) Define a "great circle" and its relationship to the slerp (spherical linear interpolation) function.

* Describe the various buffers that constitute the OpenGL framebuffer and the related tests.

* Define fractal dimension and calculate it for basic examples.

* Describe simple fractals having dimension 1 &lt; D = ln N / ln M &lt; 2, where N and M are natural numbers.

* (not in w0405) Explain the 2-D midpoint displacement algorithm for terrain generation.

* (not in w0405) Describe the basics of the Julia-Fatou sets and the Mandlebröt set.

* Define an affine map in terms of either Cartesian or homogeneous coordinates.

* Implement a fractal generator given a probabilistic affine map parameter set.
