title: "CS-421 Term Project"
---

You may work alone or in groups of two or three on the term project.
Projects should have a scope in proportion to the number of team members
(budget at least 4 hours per week per team member).  Your project
should include at least the following:

* 3-D graphics;
* meaningful user interaction;
* application of some advanced graphics concepts discussed in this course.

You are <strong>NOT</strong> restricted to OpenGL, Qt, or Linux.
There are many 3-D graphics APIs that merit study
(<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/?url=/nhp/?contentid=28000410">DirectX</a>,
<a href="http://www.povray.org/">POV-Ray</a>, etc.) and I will be
flexible in allowing you to choose a topic and API that suit your
interests as long as the scope is appropriate.

## Project Proposal
Due: 11 P.M. Monday of week 7 (5% of project grade)

Submit a
project proposal in memo form that addresses the following:

* the title of your project;
* your team, if any;
* the scope and content of your project;
* a best guess at the API and hardware support you might need;
* a tentative development schedule that includes an interim progress
  milestone with written deliverables (e.g., feasibility and research summary,
  initial design, etc.) (This should have a <strong>specific date</strong> 
  and <b>specific
  deliverables</b> that you will be turning in as part of your grade. Your
  grade will, in part, depend on how well you meet your own deadline.).

## Interim Report
Due: per proposal (25% of project grade)

## <a href="presentation.html">Presentation and Demonstration</a>
Scheduled: Wednesday and Thursday of week 10 (20% of project grade)

## Final Report
Due: 11 P.M. Friday of week 10 (50% of project grade)

* Prepare your report in PDF, Word, or XML (cctHW.xsl, or other approved XSL) format
* Include...
  * a discussion of your project area including sufficient coverage of any
      background or research material so that any other student in the course
      can understand what you've done;
  * suitable analysis and design documents (perhaps UML, etc.) that are synchronized
      with the final version of your project;
  * user documentation that describes how to build and use your project;
  * documented source code;
  * a summary (dates, times, durations, and interruption
      durations) of your activity log indicating how much time you spent
      on the assignment. Use the following categories:
      * Design
      * Coding
      * Debug (before you think it's working)
      * Test (after you think it's working)
      * Documentation
      * Other
  * an analysis of how well you met your tentative schedule;
  * a summary of the number of lines of code written or modified (by
      module, if appropriate) to complete this project;
  * any suggestions on how to improve this project in future years.
  * Code documentation with appropriate diagrams as produced by doxygen,
      javadoc, or a similar in-source documentation tool.
* Follow the report submission requirements.
* Email this file to the instructor with a subject and message
    body indicating that this is your CS-421 final project submission.
