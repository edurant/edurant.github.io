## Lab assignments

Lab reports will be submitted by email to <a href="mailto:durant@msoe.edu">durant@msoe.edu</a>. They must meet the specifications given in the assignment. Generally this means submitting a well organized collection of key calculations, schematics, layouts, and PSpice waveforms with a cover page. A brief caption should be included explaining each figure. A detailed narrative is not required. The report must be contained in a single Word file or PDF. If additional files need to be submitted, combine them with your report in a single Zip archive.

## Software

Starting with lab 1, you will need a version of PSpice with schematic support. The recommended version is 9.1, which is what is on the MSOE images. You can download it from [link no longer available]. If you have a newer version from another class, that will work as well. (Note that the complete OrCAD 10.5 demo CD is also available, but OrCAD has removed schematics support from this version.)

Software needed for later labs (not currently posted on this website): Microwind 2.7, Dsch 2.7
