## Academic Honesty

Students are expected to observe high standards of professional
ethics. These standards include honesty in all matters and giving proper
credit to the contributions of others. For example, it is dishonest to
turn in programs that do not work correctly without explaining the
shortcomings in accompanying documentation.

You are encouraged to discuss assignments with your colleagues, but
you must do your own work. This may include discussing the structure or
syntax and meaning of various, <em>specific</em> parts of a design.  However,
examining another student's work outside of this limited context is
<em>not</em> acceptable, <em>regardless</em> of whether you have his or her
permission, except for the purposes of assigned reviews and group
projects or after all parties have submitted their assignments.

You must acknowledge the original ideas of others unless they are
widely known in the field. If you have any doubt, you should acknowledge
an idea. If you have questions about any of these standards or what you
should do in a particular situation, <em>please ask me</em>. Failure to observe
these standards will result in penalties ranging from an F on an
assignment to an F for the course.

Recycling of work (borrowing heavily from previous work, including
prose and code, often done for a different class) is allowed with certain
restrictions. First, you must discuss how you intend to recycle and build upon your work
with me and gain approval well in advance of the assignment due date.
Also, you must cite your prior work.

## Laptop and Device Use

You may use your laptop computer in lecture and laboratory for appropriate activities such as note-taking,
to follow-along with classroom examples, or to test designs and run simulations. However, consider that
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/business/laptops-not-during-lecture-or-meeting.html">much
recent research shows that there are learning drawbacks to using laptops for note-taking</a>.
Do not instant message, use Facebook, watch videos, or play games during lecture or laboratory.
These activities are important parts of modern life but distract other students around you.
There are more appropriate times for these activities.

## Grading

Grades will be based on a weighted average of all graded work. The
weights for the main categories (tests, labs, homework, etc.) will be
given during the first week of class. In general, the
<a href="http://catalog.msoe.edu/content.php?catoid=16&navoid=436#Grades_and_Grading">MSOE grading scale</a>
will be used. I may use a more favorable scale when appropriate, such as
when it would result in better agreement between clusters of scores and
assigned grades.

## Exams

If you have a valid excuse
for missing an exam, you must contact me in advance to discuss your
situation and to make arrangements to take the exam at another time.
Exams missed without making such prior arrangements may only be taken
later under the most exceptional of circumstances.

## Laboratory

Some labs will be conducted individually, while others will be
conducted in small groups. If the assignment does not
specify otherwise, a lab is to be conducted individually.
Specific requirements will be
listed in the assignment or on the associated course website.

## Late Labs and Assignments

Lab reports and other assignments must be submitted at or before the
specified time on the specified due date.  Late assignments will generally be
penalized by 10% of the maximum grade for every business day or part of
a business day they are late.  Certain assignments, normally homework
assignments, may not be accepted late, particularly if the solution was given in
class.  Certain time-critical assignments, especially demos and homework in certain classes, will be penalized
at double or triple the normal rate.  Assignments may not be accepted after 11&nbsp;P.M.
on Friday of week 10.

## Attendance

Regular attendance is a foundational element of academic success and
attendance will be recorded at various times throughout the quarter.  You
should check with me if you need to miss class for any reason so that
we can ensure that you have a plan to stay up to date on the material.

I will not drop you for missing class.  If you wish to drop the
course, I recommend that you first check with me and your academic
advisor.  After that, please consult the Registrar's Office for the 
<a href="https://www.msoe.edu/academics/departments/registrar/">appropriate form
and procedure</a>.

## Announcements

Important announcements will generally be made in class or lab, but
you are responsible for regularly checking your MSOE email and should also
regularly check the course website.

## Student Accessibility Services (SAS)

For students with documented disabilities, chronic medication conditions and mental health concerns;
MSOE provides services to make reasonable accommodations available.
If you are a student who requires or anticipates the need for accommodations,
please contact Student Accessibility Services Office at 414-277-7281, by email at <a href="mailto:moureau@msoe.edu">moreau@msoe.edu</a>,
or in person at K250 to discuss appropriate accommodations and eligibility requirements.
