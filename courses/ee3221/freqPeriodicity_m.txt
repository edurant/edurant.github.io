%  Demonstrate periodicity in frequency - see page 33 of textbook for more information.

w1 = 2*pi*0.375; % radians per sample
w2 = 2*pi*1.375; % 2pi more radians per sample.
% After trying this, instead of (0.375+1) for w2, try (0.375-1).  Note that this 
% results in a negative frequency for the cosine.  What is the relationship 
% between the cos(x) and cos(-x)?  What does this tell you about negative frequencies?
% Also, try other values such as 0.2 and 1.2, etc.

n = 0:4; % sample numbers

y1_5 = cos(w1*n); % sampled cosines
y2_5 = cos(w2*n);

plot(n,y1_5,'ko', n,y2_5,'bo') % Plot both sampled cosines vs sample number; blacK and Blue circles
xlabel('Sample number')

t = linspace(0,max(n)); % see what's going on between the integer samples, default 100 samples for plenty of detail (approximate continuous signal)

hold on % add to existing plot instead of replacing it
plot(t,cos(w1*t),'k-', t,cos(w2*t),'b-')
hold off
