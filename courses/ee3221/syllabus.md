## Textbook

[Signals and Systems: Theory and Applications](https://ss2.eecs.umich.edu/) by Fawwaz T. Ulaby and Andrew E. Yagle, published 2018, ISBN: 978-1-60785-486-9

## General Course Format

Most lab assignments will last 1 week. Be sure to review them and do any assigned pre-work soon after they're posted in Canvas so that you're prepared for the lab period. Many of the labs will require checking out the FM4 hardware and an Analog Discovery from TSC.

There will be weekly homework due in lab. Most students choose hard-copy submission, but Canvas submission is also available.

There will be weekly quizzes in lab. You may use your current homework as a reference during quizzes.

## Attendance

Regular attendance is a foundational element of academic success and
attendance will be recorded at various times throughout the quarter. You
should check with me if you need to miss class for any reason so that
we can ensure that you have a plan to stay up to date on the material.

Faculty members cannot drop you for missing class. If you wish to drop the
course, I recommend that you first check with me and your academic
advisor. After that, please consult the Registrar's Office for the
[appropriate form and procedure](https://www.msoe.edu/academics/departments/registrar/).

## Grading

| Area | Weight |
| --- | ---: |
| Homework | 5% |
| Quiz | 15% |
| Lab | 30% |
| Midterm | 20% |
| Final | 30% |
| Total | 100% |

The lowest quiz will be dropped.

In general, I use the [MSOE grading scale](https://catalog.msoe.edu/content.php?catoid=22&navoid=623#Grades_and_Grading). I may use a more favorable scale when appropriate, such as when it would result in better agreement between clusters of scores and assigned grades.

An incomplete final grade (e.g., F*) is rarely awarded and only under extenuating circumstances.

### Late Labs and Homework

Lab reports and other assignments must be submitted at or before the specified time on the specified due date. Late assignments will generally be penalized by 10% of the maximum grade for every business day or part of a business day they are late. Certain assignments, normally homework, may not be accepted late, particularly if the solution was given. Certain time-critical assignments, especially demos and homework in certain classes, will be penalized at double or triple the normal rate. Assignments may not be accepted after 5&nbsp;P.M. on Friday of week 10.

### Exams
* If you have a valid excuse for missing an exam, you must contact me in advance to discuss your situation and to make arrangements to take the exam at another time. Exams missed without making such prior arrangements may only be taken later under the most exceptional of circumstances.
* The midterm and the final are in-person and on paper.
* The midterm is given during the week 6 lab period (there is no week 6 quiz).
* The final is given in week 11 per the schedule published by the Registrar's Office. The exam schedule is normally published by the end of week 4. The final may cover any material from the course. The final will last 2 hours.

### Homework
* Homework will be assigned throughout the quarter and is due as specified.
* Homework must be done on 8.5 inch by 11 inch paper (original paper, scanned hardcopy, PDF from software program such as OneNote, etc. are acceptable) with ≈1 inch margins on all sides. Violating this format may result in rejection of the submission. Either in-person submisssion in lab or electronic submission in Canvas is acceptable.
* Mark each problem number distinctly and clearly.

## Sources of Academic Help: Class sessions, Office, Canvas, Teams, Email

* Check Canvas for supplementary materials.
* Use email or Teams chat for course-related content communications. Course-related content student messages with instructor responses can be broadcast to everyone in the class – you must specifically indicate in your message if you do not wish it to be broadcast.
* See the professor's schedule on his website for office hour policies.

## Academic Honesty

Students are expected to observe high standards of professional
ethics. These standards include honesty in all matters and giving proper
credit to the contributions of others. For example, it is dishonest to
turn in programs that do not work correctly without explaining the
shortcomings in accompanying documentation.

You are encouraged to discuss homework assignments with your colleagues, but
you must do your own work. This may include discussing the structure or
syntax and meaning of various, *specific* parts of a design. However,
examining another student's work outside of this limited context is
*not* acceptable, *regardless* of whether you have his or her
permission, except for the purposes of assigned reviews and group
projects or after all parties have submitted their assignments.

You must acknowledge the original ideas of others unless they are
widely known in the field. If you have any doubt, you should acknowledge
an idea. If you have questions about any of these standards or what you
should do in a particular situation, *please ask me*. Failure to observe
these standards will result in penalties ranging from an F on an
assignment to an F for the course.

Recycling of work (borrowing heavily from previous work, including
prose and code, often done for a different class) is allowed with certain
restrictions. First, you must discuss how you intend to recycle and build upon your work
with me and gain approval well in advance of the assignment due date.
Also, you must cite your prior work.

Normal student integrity violation penalty: expulsion from the course with a grade of F. Minimum penalty: zero on the assignment and one grade rank reduction in final course grade.

## Laptop and Device Use

You may use your laptop computer in lecture and laboratory for appropriate activities such as note-taking,
to follow-along with classroom examples, or to test designs and run simulations. However, consider that
[much recent research shows that there are learning drawbacks to using laptops for note-taking](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/business/laptops-not-during-lecture-or-meeting.html).
Do not instant message, use Facebook, watch videos, or play games during lecture or laboratory.
These activities are important parts of modern life but distract other students around you.
There are more appropriate times for these activities.

## Additional Institutional Policies (beyond those linked in the course syllabus in Canvas)
