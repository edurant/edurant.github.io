title: "Dr. Durant: CSC4601/5601 Theory of Machine Learning"
---

## Overview

Welcome to Theory of Machine Learning! This course provides a broad introduction to
machine learning. Theory of machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms
that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms operate by building a model
from example inputs in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions, rather than following
strictly static program instructions. Topic categories include decision boundaries, optimization,
and both supervised and unsupervised methods. Students will apply the theory to
implementation and evaluation of machine learning algorithms with hands-on, tutorial-oriented
laboratory exercises.

### CSC4601 (Undergraduate) Details
* Structure: 2-2-3
* See details including prerequisites in the [undergraduate catalog entry](https://catalog.msoe.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=35&coid=40224)

### CSC5601 (Graduate) Details
* Structure: 4-0-4
* See details including prerequisites in the [graduate catalog entry](https://catalog.msoe.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=36&coid=41215&print)

Graduate students enrolled in the course will complete all the undergraduate assignments plus some additional assignments. The graduate section meets simultaneously with the undergraduate section per the published schedule.

## Course in Canvas
* Spring, 2024: Link will be posted when available. Until then, please use this website and submit completed assignments via email.

## Toolset

For the first few weeks, I recommend that you work locally on your laptop. The faculty are working on a Singularity image for [Rosie](https://docs.hpc.msoe.edu/) that includes all the needed packages; until then, you may encounter additional challenges trying to complete some parts of the assignment on Rosie.

## Tentative Class Schedule
You should expect 1-2 lectures on new material per week. Lecture time will also be used to work
on problems that direct relate to the lecture topics. These in-class problems may take the form of
a code demonstration or individual time to work on some of the problems. Lab time will
typically be used for larger projects (labs) that will be due within a week of assignment.
Occasionally, a lab may be replaced by a larger problem set. This class will have two exams
(Midterm and Final) as well as a term project that will be assigned half-way through the course.

## Textbook
There are no required textbooks for this course.
There will be notes released for major topics and it is expected that you read them. They may
have additional references at the end.

## Lecture Notes
You will be required to take notes for our lectures. Scan your notes with an app like Microsoft
Lens and submit a PDF through Canvas. Notes will be treated as a participation grade and will be
graded pass / fail. You are free to use any note-taking style or approach that works best for you.

## Problem Sets
Problem sets will be used in conjunction with lectures and labs. The goals of the problem sets are
to (1) practice concepts from the lectures, especially conceptual or mathematical concepts that do
not fit naturally into a lab, (2) help you assess your own understanding of the lectures, and (3)
give practice with concepts that didn't fit into the labs. Problem sets will be graded by randomly
selecting 1-2 problems per set and grading for correctness and completeness. In class problem
sets will be worth fewer points than problem sets that are given for a lab. Time permitting, we
will review solutions together in class, and I'll answer any questions that might come up.
Solutions will not be posted, and the associated lecture will not be recorded; you will need to
attend class to see the solutions.
