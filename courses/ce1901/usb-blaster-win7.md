10/5/2010, Dr. Durant

Note: This method does not require rebooting with the unsigned drivers option

1. Unzip the [usb-blaster.zip](usb-blaster.zip) file provided by Dr. Rothe to a convenient location (e.g., your desktop).  This will create a usb-blaster folder.
2. Connect USB Blaster to USB port on laptop (UP2 board does not need to be plugged in)
3. Receive unsuccessful installation message
4. Go to the Device Manager (can search from Start menu)
5. Right click on Unknown device under Other devices
6. Update driver software…
7. Browse my computer for driver software
8. Browse to the folder with the zip file contents.  Do not go into a subdirectory (e.g., use usb-blaster, not x64)
9. Ok, Ok, Next
10. Warning message appears: “Windows can’t verify the publisher of this driver software”
11. Click “install this driver software anyway”
12. Receive success message that “Altera USB-Blaster” has been installed
13. Close
