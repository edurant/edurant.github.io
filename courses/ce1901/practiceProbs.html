<p>Abbreviation of dates: WmDn refers to the nth day of lecture in the mth week of class.  WmL refers to the lab in week m.  For example, W3D2 is the 2nd lecture
of week 3 (regardless of whether the lab period is before or after the 2nd lecture period).</p>

<h2>W1D1<!-- (10 points, due W1D2)--></h2>

<ol start=1>
<li>List the powers of 2 starting with the 0th power and ending with the 16th power.</li>

<li>Convert 151, 257, and 640 from decimal to binary.  Show all calculations.</li>

<li>Convert 1011, 1010_0101, and 0111_1101_1010 from unsigned binary to decimal. Illustrate key steps.</li>

<li>In decimal (base 10), we can quickly divide by 10 by dropping the least significant digit from the right of a number (e.g., 387 becomes 38 -- note this rounds down).  What similar shortcut can be taken for division in binary (base 2)?  Demonstrate the outcome for the binary number 1_0001.</li>

<li>Convert 3F and 3CEA from hexadecimal to both decimal and binary.  Illustrate key steps.</li>

<ol start=9>

<li>Draw a truth table for the 3-input AND and OR functions.</li>

<li>Draw the truth table for the following Boolean functions: F(xyz) = x'y'z + x'yz' + xyz', F(xyz) = (y'z'+yz)[y'+z'(xz)']. Include columns for <em>all</em> intermediate terms.</li>

</li>

</ol>

<h2>W2D2<!-- (10 points, due W3D1)--></h2>

<ol start=11>

<li>P1.35, P1.38 (pages 34-); Derive the Boolean function for the truth table as in Table 1.7 (page 13) where F1 = 10011000, where the MSB (on the left) corresponds to minterm 7 (bottom to top)</li>

<h2>W3D1<!-- (10 points, due W3D2)--></h2>

<ol start=13>

<li>F(abc) = m0 + m1 + m2 + m3 + m4

<ol type=a>
<li>Draw the truth table for F.  (Note: For equations in canonical form, beginning this week, it is not
    necessary to show intermediate steps in the truth table.)</li>
<li>Express F in canonical sum of products form without using a shorthand notation</li>
<li>Express F as a sum of minterms using &Sigma; notation</li>
<li>Draw a Karnaugh map for F.  Box in the prime implicants (for each 1-minterm, the largest subcube [see class notes or textbook]
    that contains it; some of these will cover more than 1 term, so you will generally have far fewer boxes than minterms).

<li>Using your result from the previous step, write a minimized sum-of-products version of F.</li>
<li>Show how to implement your equation from the previous step using NOT/AND/OR gates.  (Or, if you prefer, only NAND gates; see Figure 1.15 on page 31.)</li>
</ol>

</ol>

<h2>W4D1<!-- (20 points, due W4D2)--></h2>

<ol start=14>

<li>Given the following 4-variable Boolean function F(wxyz):
	<ul>
		<li>1-minterms: 1, 5, 11, 13, 15</li>
		<li>Don't care minterms: 3, 9, 14</li>
	</ul>
<ol type=a>
<li>Draw a K-map to show how to find the simplest sum-of-products form.  Take the best possible advantage of don't cares.  Be sure that you label, on the K-map, each term
that you select for the reduced function.  Also, state the fully reduced SOP function.</li>
<li>Re-do all parts of the previous item, including labeled K-map reduction, but this time ignore the don't cares (they must output 0).</li>

</ol>

<h2>W5D2<!-- (7 points, due W6D1)--></h2>

<ol start=16>
<li>Calculate the range of an 8-bit unsigned number.</li>
<li>Calculate the range of an 8-bit signed number.</li>
<li>Convert -80 and -40 to 8-bit signed format.</li>
<li>Perform binary addition of the 2 8-bit numbers above.</li>
<li>Interpret the sum as the unsigned result of adding two unsigned numbers.  Is there unsigned overflow?</li>
<li>Interpret the sum as the signed result of adding two signed numbers.  Is there signed overflow?</li>
</ol>

<h2>W7D2<!-- (10 points, due W8L)--></h2>

<ol start=22>
<p><li>Design an ALU that performs the following 4 operations:
<ul>
<li>S=00: Subtract  (A-B)</li>
<li>S=01: Decrement (A-1)</li>
<li>S=10: Or        (A OR B)</li>
<li>S=11: Nand      (A NAND B)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The design will consist of
<ol type="a">
<li>(required) a function table</li>
<li>(optional) a truth table for the logic extender</li>
<li>(optional) a truth table for the arithmetic extender</li>
<li>(optional) a truth table for the carry extender</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Next, reduce the LE, AE, and CE equations.  Some of the equations may be
simple enough to write directly from the tables above.  For the remaining ones, however,
it will be necessary to show a K-map to ensure that you have found the simplest sum-of-products
implementation.  (An alternative design method is to use 4:1 or 16:1 MUXes,
but for this problem you must use K-maps.)</p>

<p>The final element of the design is to show how these 3 components, which you may now represent
using block symbols (do not draw all the gates), are connected to FAs (full adders) to create an
ALU.  Be sure to show at least a 2-bit ALU so that the connections of the FA carry inputs and
outputs are unambiguous.</p></li>

</ol>

<h2>W8D1<!-- (10 points, due W8D2)--></h2>

<ol start=23>
<li>Draw the gate schematic for the 2-to-4 decoder with enable.</li>
<li>Draw the gate schematic for the 8-to-3 encoder.</li>
<li>Show how you could combine five 2-to-4 decoders to make a 4-to-16 decoder. All decoders in this problem have an enable input.  Draw only the blocks for the decoder components (not the gates).  Hint: if the 2 MSBs are both on, you know that one of the outputs between 1100 (12) and 1111 (15) is on.</li>
</ol>

<h2>W8D2<!-- (10 points, due W9D1)--></h2>

<ol start=26>
<li>Draw the circuit for a 4-to-2 priority encoder using the intermediate V signals as discussed in class.</li>
<li>Use three 16-to-1 multiplexers to implement a 4-to-2 priority encoder.  Remember that a 2^N:1 MUX implements a truth table with N inputs.</li>
<li>Which of the above designs requires more gates?</li>
<li>Why might you use the design with more gates instead of the one with fewer?</li>
</ol>

<h2>W9D1<!-- (15 points, due W9D2)--></h2>

<ol start=30>
<li><p>P4.19.  Do this in Quartus, turning in your (a) <strong>schematic</strong> for the 4:2
priority encoder, (b) your <strong>VHDL or schematic</strong> for the 2:1 priority encoder, and (c) your simulation for the 4:2 priority encoder showing all possible input combinations.
If you choose to use buses for the inputs to the 2:1 priority encoder, they must be named
with care.  For example, you may have a need to take 2 signals off a bus of 4 signals and
put them onto another bus.  One way to do this is...</p>

<pre>X[3..0] ===============
           |       |
           |X[3]   |X[2]
           |       |
          ====================
                       X[3..2]</pre>

<p>To keep the wiring simpler, you may wish to avoid using buses for this assignment.</p>

<p>You may use the "21mux" component that is available in Quartus (be sure to label whether A is D0 or D1), or you may implement your own 2:1 MUX.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>W10D2<!-- (10 points, due W10 Friday)--></h2>

<ol start=31>
<li>Derive the truth table for comparing two unsigned 2-bit operands for the greater-than-or-equal-to relationship.  Derive the equation and circuit from this truth table. Note: This is <em>not</em> the "ripple" comparator designed in class.</li>
<li>Draw the circuit for a 4-bit shifter that realizes the following operation table.
  <ul>
  <li>S = 0: Rotate left</li>
  <li>S = 1: Arithmetic right shift</li>
  <li>S = 2: Output 0</li>
  <li>S = 3: Rotate right</li>
  <li>S = 4: Shift right and fill with 0 (what's the other name for this operation?)</li>
  <li>S = 5: Pass through</li>
  <li>S = 6: Shift left and fill with 0</li>
  <li>S = 7: Output +1 in signed binary</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<!--
<li>P4.33: Hint: You only need 2<sup>3</sup> input rows.  Write outputs as needed in
    terms of the d<sub>i</sub> inputs.</li>
