title: "Dr. Durant: CS-4981 Deep Learning in Signal Processing"
---

* Majors: BME (see note below), CE, CS, and SE
* Prerequisites: MA383 and (CS2040 or CS3210)
* Structure: 2-2-3

## Overview

This elective course provides an overview of deep learning methods and models as used in digital signal processing (DSP), including key DSP concepts that appear in and adjacent to such models in both real-time and off-line applications. Key topics include training pipelines, convolutional layers of various dimensions used on both time series and time-frequency representations of data, common network architectures, mitigation of overfitting, error metrics, and performance evaluation. Topics of student interest will be addressed by special lecture topics and course projects.

This is a new, special-topics elective being offered for the first time in spring, 2022.

## Toolset

The toolset is TBD. The professor is investigating whether MATLAB's Deep Learning Toolbox will running on Rosie will meet our needs. If not, Jupyter notebooks with Python/TensorFlow will likely be used. The course does not assume knowledge of MATLAB or Python, etc.

## BMEs

BMEs who want to take the course must have completed BE2200 and EE3221. The professor is willing to recommend a prerequisite waiver for these students, but final approval lies at the department level. Students may register without meeting the prerequisites, but may receive notice that they will be removed during week 1 if they have not resolved prerequisite issues.
