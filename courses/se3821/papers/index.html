<h1>SE-3821 Software Requirements and Specification
<br>Paper Presentations</h1>

<P>This assignment counts for 5% of your quarter grade. Your group of 2 or 3 has only
15 minutes to summarize the key points from the paper you choose to present,
so be sure to prioritize this assignment accordingly.</P>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>As part of the course, each student will make a
paper presentation on a paper or article related to software requirements.
A variety of papers and articles will be available from the instructor from which you
will choose.</p>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>You must confirm the paper or article (publication, author,
      date, etc.) in an email to the instructor by 4:00 P.M. on
      Monday of week 4.</strong></li>
  <li>The week 7 meetings will be dedicated to presentations.
      Please be prompt.</li>
  <li>Presentations are limited to 15 minutes. Presenters
      exceeding this limit risk being unceremoniously cut off. A short
      period for questions and comments from the audience will be provided
      and is not included in the limit.</li>
  <li>Each group should arrange for any necessary audio-visual equipment.
      The instructor will consult on this process if needed.</li>
  <li>Grading will be based on content, clarity,
      summary of key paper points, appropriate use of audio-visual equipment, ability to answer
      questions, and appropriate use of time. <a href="presentationEvaluation.pdf">(Evaluation
      sheet&#8212;may be refined before Wednesday of week 5.)</a></li>
  <li>You should take this assignment seriously as it accounts for 5% of
      your quarter grade. Students who do not devote adequate time to
      studying their paper and preparing their presentation should expect to receive
      a poor grade.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Team Peer Evaluation</h2>

<p>Upon completion of the presentation, each team member must complete the
<a href="/~taylor/files/teameval.pdf">Team Peer Evaluation
Form</a> and turn it in by <strong><span style="color: red">5 P.M. on
