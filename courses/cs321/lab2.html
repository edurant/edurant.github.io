<p>This is a 2-week lab. Please refer to http://people.msoe.edu/~cs321/lab2.shtml [no longer online]
for details.</p>

<h2>Lab report (due 4 P.M., the day prior to week 4 lab)</h2>

<p>Your lab report need not be self-contained. This means that it is 
<strong>not</strong> necessary to restate the entire specification in your report.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Prepare your report in the XML format described in the
      Electronic Submission
      Guidelines.</li>
  <li>Include...
  <ul>
      <li>a brief overview of the assignment;</li>
      <li>details of any problems you encountered;</li>
      <li>suggestions for how the lab could be improved;</li>
      <li>things you could not figure out how to do;</li>
      <li>a list of extra features that you implemented, if any;</li>
      <li>a tally of the number of new Non-comment Lines Of Code (NLOC) written
          for this lab assignment. Use the
          <a href="http://www.chris-lott.org/resources/cmetrics/">CLC
          Perl script</A> on your code. It will report how many lines and
          statements you wrote in each source file.
        <ul>
          <li>For accurate
          results run it on the provided code first and then subtract
          those results since you did not write that code.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A summary of your activity log indicating how much time you spent
          on the assignment (following the template provided in
          lab2.xml).
        <ul>
          <li>Use the following phases, along
          with roughly 5-10 words explaining what was done during each work
          session.
          <ul>
            <li>Research</li>
            <li>Design</li>
            <li>Code</li>
            <li>Debug (before you think it's working)</li>
            <li>Test (after you think it's working)</li>
            <li>Administrative (includes report writing)</li>
          </ul>

          <li>If you work from 2:00 P.M. to 3:30 P.M. and are interrupted
              for a 10-minute phone call, the interruption time is 10 and the
              delta time is 80.</li>
          <li>"Whom" should be "Self" except when you're consulting/discussing the
              project with the professor or other students.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Documented source code<br/>
          You may wish to use
          <a href="/~taylor/files/gensrc"><TT><STRONG>gensrc</STRONG></TT></A>, a shell
          script which will produce an XML document that may be used as a
          starting point for your report. The file will include all of the
          source code files (provided you modify the script appropriately...
          edit <TT><STRONG>gensrc</STRONG></TT> for details on how to do this.)</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Follow the report submission requirements.</li>
