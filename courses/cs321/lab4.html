title: "CS-321 Lab 4: Adding Lines and Color"

<!-- For 2005, consider making file load/save explicit requirements, here, or in the common document. 
-->

<p>This is a 1-week lab. Please refer to http://people.msoe.edu/~cs321/lab4b.shtml [no longer online] for the lab
details.</p>

<h2>UML Class and Sequence Diagrams</h2>

<p>Before writing your code for this week, update your <a 
href="http://www.smartdraw.com/resources/centers/uml/uml2.htm">UML class
diagram</a> from last week and create an additional <a
href="http://www.dotnetcoders.com/web/learning/uml/diagrams/sequence.aspx">UML
sequence diagram</a> that illustrates some non-trivial new function of this
week's program.   These new and updated diagrams should be included as PNG
files in your XML report, where you should give the user an overview of the
diagrams with additional information not obvious from the diagrams&#8212;do
not simply re-tell the user what the UML diagrams already convey.</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>

<ul>
<li>Add one function at a time (examples:
button set up,
button signals/slots
line drawing command, 
multiple color support,
line drawing with mouse)
and test each function before moving on to the next one.</li>

<li>The <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/qcolordialog.html">QColorDialog</a> method of 
setting a color is required, but 
you may add additional color-selection methods if you wish.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Demonstration (during week 6 lab)</h2>

<p>You will need to demonstrate your project to the instructor during the
week 6 lab meeting. The demonstration will count for 25% of your
project grade.</p>

<h2>Lab report (due 4 P.M., the day prior to the week 6 lab)</h2>

<p>Your lab report need not be self-contained. This means that it is 
<strong>not</strong> necessary to restate the entire specification in your report.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Prepare your report in the XML format described in the
      Electronic Submission Guidelines.</li>
  <li>Include...
  <ul>
      <li>a brief overview of the assignment;</li>
      <li>details of any problems you encountered;</li>
      <li>suggestions for how the lab could be improved;</li>
      <li>things you could not figure out how to do;</li>
      <li>a list of extra features that you implemented, if any;</li>
      <li>a tally of the number of Non-commented new Lines Of Code (NLOC) written
          for this lab assignment.  Follow the requirements for this item
          from <a href="lab2.html">lab 2</a>.</li>
      <li>A summary of your activity log indicating how much time you spent
          on the assignment.  Follow the requirements for this item
          from <a href="lab2.html">lab 2</a>.</li>
      <li>Documented source code&#8212;See
          <a href="lab2.html">lab 2</a> for information on gensrc, which
          helps format your code for your XML report.
          <ul>
            <li>If a file has not changed since the last assignment, note this in your
                report and do not include the unchanged file.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Follow the report submission requirements.</li>
  <li>Email this file to the instructor (<a
      href="mailto:durant@msoe.edu">durant@msoe.edu</a>) with a subject and message
      body indicating that this is your CS-321 Lab 4 submission.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you have any questions, consult the instructor.</p>
