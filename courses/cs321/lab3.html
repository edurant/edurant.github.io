title: "CS-321 Lab 3: Introduction To the Graphics Shell"
---

<p>This is a 1-week lab. Please refer to http://people.msoe.edu/~cs321/lab3.shtml [no longer online] for the lab
details.</p>

<h2>UML Class and Sequence Diagrams</h2>

<p>Before writing your code for this week, model your existing work and develop your design using 
a UML editing tool.  Specifically, use** Visio (Windows) or <a 
href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/dia/">Dia</a> (Windows or Linux***) to prepare a <a 
href="http://www.smartdraw.com/resources/centers/uml/uml2.htm">UML class diagram</a> and a <a 
href="http://www.dotnetcoders.com/web/learning/uml/diagrams/sequence.aspx">UML sequence 
diagram</a>.</p>

<p>Your model must contain enough detail to support a non-trivial example of using your classes.  
For example...</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing a file with multiple shapes of two types (could be initiated by a function in your class derived from Shell; not required this week)</li>
<li>Clicking the mouse to create and draw a new point</li>
<li>Drawing an image (diagramming this requires a partial model of QPainter)</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to propose another example for diagramming to the instructor.</p>

<p>Save your graphics (1 class diagram and 1 sequence diagram) in <a 
href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngintro.html">PNG format</a> at a reasonable resolution for 
on-screen viewing and reference them so that they appear in your XML report (File|Save As in 
Visio, File|Export in Dia).  In your report, give the user an overview of the diagrams with 
additional information not obvious from the diagrams -- do not simply re-tell the user what the 
UML diagrams already convey.</p>

<p>**If you prefer, you may instead use Rose, a much more powerful tool that you have access to 
while on campus (the Department has 100 licenses managed by a license server).  Rose has a 
shallower learning curve (meaning that it takes longer to gain proficiency), but is also much 
more powerful.  Rose has a Web Export feature that, among other things, generates PNG versions of 
all diagrams.</p>

<p>***If dia is not available (dia&amp; from command prompt), execute `up2date dia` as root to 
install it on your Linux setup.</p>

<h2>Other Requirements</h2>

<p>These requirements are in addition to those listed on the common lab page linked to above.</p>

<ul>

<li>Override the Erase function from Shell so that the user may erase the image
by pressing the Erase button.  This should cause the image object to become empty and
the drawing shown on the screen to become blank.</li>

</ul>

<p>Note: It is not necessary to handle loading and saving, but these features will be required in
future labs, so you might want to get a start on them.</p>

<h2>Demonstration (during week 5 lab)</h2>

<p>You will need to demonstrate your project to the instructor during the 
week 5 lab meeting.  The demonstration will count for 25% of your
project grade.</p>

<h2>Lab report (due 4 P.M., the day prior to week 5 lab)</h2>

<p>Your lab report need not be self-contained. This means that it is 
<strong>not</strong> necessary to restate the entire specification in your report.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Prepare your report in the XML format described in the
      Electronic Submission
      Guidelines.</li>
  <li>Include...
  <ul>
      <li>a brief overview of the assignment;</li>
      <li>details of any problems you encountered;</li>
      <li>suggestions for how the lab could be improved;</li>
      <li>things you could not figure out how to do;</li>
      <li>a list of extra features that you implemented, if any;</li>
      <li>a tally of the number of Non-commented new Lines Of Code (NLOC) written
          for this lab assignment.  Follow the requirements for this item
          from <a href="lab2.html">lab 2</a>.</li>
      <li>A summary of your activity log indicating how much time you spent
          on the assignment.  Follow the requirements for this item
          from <a href="lab2.html">lab 2</a>.</li>
      <li>Documented source code&#8212;See
          <a href="lab2.html">lab 2</a> for information on gensrc, which
          helps format your code for your XML report.
          <ul>
            <li>If a file has not changed since the last assignment, note this in your
                report and do not include the unchanged file.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Follow the report submission requirements.</li>
  <li>Email this file to the instructor (<a
      href="mailto:durant@msoe.edu">durant@msoe.edu</a>) with a subject and message
      body indicating that this is your CS-321 Lab 3 submission.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you have any questions, consult the instructor.</p>
