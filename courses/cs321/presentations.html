title: "Dr. Durant: CS-321 Computer Graphics: Oral Presentations (Fall 2004)"
---

<P>This assignment counts for 10% of your quarter grade.
You only have
5 minutes to convince the class that you are knowledgeable on the subject
you choose to present, so be sure to adequately prioritize this
assignment.</P>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<P>As part of the course, each student will make a brief (five minute)
technical presentation on some subject related to computer graphics. Some
possible subjects are:</P>

<ul>
  <li>A graphics rendering algorithm.</li>
  <li>A hardware component of a graphics system.</li>
  <li>A programming technique found useful in the lab.</li>
  <li>A new application of computer graphics.</li>
</ul>

<P>This list is meant to stimulate ideas, not to limit the range of topics.</P>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>You must submit your topic to the instructor by 4:00 P.M. on
      Monday of week 6.</strong></li>
  <li>Presentations will be scheduled at the beginning of the class period.
      Therefore, presenters and other class members must be prompt.</li>
  <li>Presentations are limited to five minutes in duration. Presenters
      exceeding this limit risk being unceremoniously cut off. A short
      period for questions and comments from class members will be provided
      and is not included in the five minute limit.</li>
  <li>Each presenter should arrange for any necessary audio-visual equipment.
      The instructor will consult on this process if needed.</li>
  <li>Grading will be based on content, clarity, relation of topic to computer
      graphics, appropriate use of audio-visual equipment, ability to answer
      questions, and appropriate use of time.

  <li>You should take this assignment seriously as it accounts for 10% of
      your quarter grade. Students who do not devote adequate time to
      researching and preparing their presentation should expect to receive
      a poor grade.</li>
</ul>
