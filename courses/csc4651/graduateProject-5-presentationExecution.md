---

This page describes the final of five project milestones.

## Instructions

The presentation execution is the final milestone in this assignment, where your team’s research, critical analysis, and understanding of the selected paper culminate in a recorded video presentation. The goal is to create an engaging, informative, and well-timed presentation that will assist your colleagues in comprehending and applying the work from the selected paper. Review the following panels for a guide to achieving this aim.

### Preparation and Practice


* **Timing:** Your presentation must fit within the 15–20-minute window. It’s vital to carefully plan each section to include all necessary content without feeling rushed.
* **Rehearsal:** Practice the presentation multiple times. This helps in ironing out any issues, ensuring that you stay within the time limit, and allows each team member to become comfortable with their part.
* **Feedback loop:** Consider a dry run with a friend or another team to get feedback on clarity, pace, and engagement.



### Content Delivery


* **Engagement:** Your delivery should be lively and engaging. Remember, your aim is not just to inform but to interest your audience in the subject matter.
* **Emphasis on key points:** Use the recorded presentation opportunity to emphasize critical aspects that you think are vital to understanding and applying the work. Visual aids, changes in tone, and pause for emphasis can be used effectively here.
* **Balance detail and clarity:** Provide enough detail without overwhelming your audience. Use plain language to explain complex concepts and make use of examples where necessary.



### Visual Aids and Demonstrations


* **Effective use of slides or code:** Ensure that your slides or code are prominently displayed and easy to follow. They should complement your verbal presentation, not simply repeat it.
* **Visual emphasis on critical points:** Use visual cues to draw attention to the essential aspects of your presentation. This could include highlighting text, using animations, or other visual techniques.



### Technical Considerations


* **Recording tools:** Use tools that you are comfortable with. Microsoft Teams is suggested, but you may use other platforms if preferred.
* **Audio quality:** Make sure that your voices are audible and clear. Consider using a good microphone and recording in a quiet environment.



### Reflection and Revision


* **Review the recording:** Watch the recorded presentation to ensure that everything is in order. Look for areas where emphasis is needed, where you might have rushed, or where additional clarity might be beneficial.
* **Make necessary adjustments:** Don’t hesitate to re-record sections if needed. Your final submission should be a polished representation of your work.



The presentation execution is more than a mere summary of your research; it’s an opportunity to communicate a complex topic in an accessible and engaging way. Proper preparation, careful timing, engaging delivery, and thoughtful use of visual aids are keys to a successful presentation. By following these guidelines, your team can create a presentation that not only fulfills the assignment’s requirements but also stands as a valuable resource for your peers.
