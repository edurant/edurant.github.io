1. If you didn't already have a Rosie account, one has been created for you. You will be prompted to change the default password (see Canvas message or professor) on first login. Follow the instructions in [the Shell Access section of the User Guide](https://docs.hpc.msoe.edu/#/access?id=shell-access) under "Shell Access." If you don't have an ssh (secure shell) client on your laptop from a previous class, it is recommended that you install PuTTY as described under "SSH Terminal Program."
1. Start MATLAB on Rosie as described on the [course homepage](./).
1. Run 3 (or more) ["Get Started" Examples from the MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/getting-started-with-deep-learning-toolbox.html). Some will not work (webcam) because of packages that are not available on Rosie.
   * First, try "Classify Image Using Pretrained Network."
   * Next, try "Create Simple Image Classification Network Using Deep Network Designer". Take a screen capture of your Training Progress plot to include in your report.
   * Complete at least 1 more example.
1. Summarize what was done (in your own words, state the goal of each example)
1. Summarize your key questions or open issues.
   * Where parts of the examples hard to understand?
   * Did you run into errors and were you able to solve them?
   * Are there topics you'd like to learn more about next?

Submit your informal report covering the above items via Canvas as a Word file, PDF, etc.

## Learning MATLAB

In this course, I intend to provide good references and commented code since very few people have much MATLAB experience. I also recommend the MathWorks&rsquo; online courses and tutorials. Some of the content is free, and if you log in with an @msoe.edu account, you have access to much more. [This 2-hour overview](https://www.mathworks.com/learn/tutorials/matlab-onramp.html) is a good place to start, and I'm always glad to answer questions about MATLAB.
