title: "CS-489 Process Details"
---

<p align="center">by Dr. Durant
<br/>This process is based on materials developed by Dr. Welch and Dr. Sebern.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>As part of the software development process for this course, all team members
are expected to track and report process data. A more detailed discussion of
this process, including spreadsheets for some of the tables, can be found on Dr. Welch's SE280 page.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgement</h2>

<p>The time and defect tracking tools used here are taken from Watts Humphrey's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Software_Process">Personal
Software Process</a> (PSP). However, they represent only one small part
of the PSP; as the course goes on, other parts of the process will be discussed.
Unfortunately, the time available does not permit training in the complete
PSP, and students are encouraged to pursue additional PSP study on their
own or as part of another course.</p>

<h2>Time tracking and reporting</h2>

<p>Time tracking is done with a time log sheet, resembling the following form:
<center><table BORDER=2 CELLPADDING=3>

<tr>
<th>Date</th>
<th>Start</th>
<th>Stop</th>
<th>Interruption Time</th>
<th>Delta Time</th>
<th>Phase</th>
<th>Comments</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

</table></center>

<p>The project phases are:

<ul>
<li>Planning (includes analysis)</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Design review</li>
<li>Coding</li>
<li>Code review</li>
<li>Compile</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Postmortem</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that these are <b>phases</b>, not <b>activities</b>. For example,
the "compile" phase begins on the first compile and ends when a "clean
compile" has been achieved, even if fixing defects in this phase requires
going back and redoing some of the analysis or design. Time spent in team
meetings and research should be included in the phase you are in, though
it should be labeled (in "comments") separately in the time recording log.

<p>During the postmortem, the time in each phase should be summarized by
developer (team member) and for the team as a whole.

<h2>Defect tracking and reporting</h2>

<p>Defect tracking is done with a defect recording log:

<br>

<table BORDER=2 CELLPADDING=3 >
<tr>
<th>Date</th>
<th>ID Number</th>
<th>Occurrences</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Inject Phase</th>
<th>Remove Phase</th>
<th>Fix Time</th>
<th>Fix Defect</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>Some notes on these items:

<ul>
<li>ID Number - a sequential serial number assigned to each defect.</li>
<li>Occurrences - number of instances of the same defect (e.g., incorrect data
object name) found at the same time.</li>
<li>Type - defect type code (see table below).</li>
<li>Fix defect - if you inject another defect (defect B) while fixing a previous
defect (defect A), put the ID number of defect A in the "fix defect" field
of defect B.</li>
</ul>

<p>Defect types:
<br>
<table BORDER=2 CELLPADDING=3 >

<td ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=TOP>100</td>
<td VALIGN=TOP>Environment</td>
<td VALIGN=TOP>design, compile, test or other support system problems</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>During the postmortem, the number of defects injected and removed in
each phase should be summarized, by developer and for the team as a whole.
The defect types should be used to improve the design and code review checklists.
