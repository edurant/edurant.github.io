title: "CS-489 Lab 2: Application Frameworks &amp; OO CASE Tool"
---

<p align="center">by Dr. Durant
<br/>This lab is based on a lab developed by Dr. Welch.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of this lab is to become familiar with a GUI application framework
and an object-oriented CASE tool, Enterprise Architect.</p>

<h2>Activities</h2>

In this lab, your team  will

<ul>
<li>Create a simple UML model</li>
<li>Build a simple GUI application</li>
<li>Report on your results</li>
</ul>

<h2>Detailed instructions</h2>

<p>Work with your assigned team on this group lab project. You may wish to
work in subgroups and integrate the results.</p>
<p>If you have difficulties with any part of the lab, consult the instructor
for assistance. The basic sequence is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new Enterprise Architect (EA) domain model (complete or partial) for
one of the class exercises:
	<ul>
	<li>Restaurant</li>
	<li>Mass transit system</li>
	<li>Role-playing game</li>
	<li>...any other example approved by the instructor</li>
	</ul>
Don't worry if it is
not very robust. The goal here is EA, not the model itself. Information on how 
to use EA can be found [no longer online].</li>


<li>Build a simple GUI application that takes user input and provides output (it may be as simple as computing the sum of two numbers). The specifics will vary
depending upon your chosen language and application framework. The recommended frameworks are:
	<ul>
	<li>C++/MFC: Follow the step-by-step
	  instructions to build a simple MFC application if you have never done so
	  before. You may add enhancements, but this is not required.</li>
	<li>Java/Swing: See this tutorial at SwingWiki [no longer online] or
            <a href="http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0240__Swing/0020__Swing-Introduction.htm">this tutorial from Java Examples</a>.
            For a more detailed introduction, you may wish to see Chapters 7 through 9 of <cite>Core Java 2 Volume I - Fundamentals, Seventh Edition</cite>
            by Cay Horstmann (via Safari)</li>
	<li>C#/Windows Forms: Follow the tutorial in Chapter 13 of <cite>Programming C#</cite>. MSOE subscribes to this book via O'Reilly's Safari service</li>
	</ul>

</li>

<li>Submit the lab report (details below).</li>

</ol>

<p>You do not need to use the code generation features in Enterprise Architect this week, but you may try them if you wish. See the help file for details.</p>

<h2>Lab report</h2>

<p>Each team will submit a single Zip file containing the following:</p>

<ul>

<li>A report with a brief description of any problems you encountered
or questions you have regarding the lab and other items noted below.</li>


<li>A copy of the EA model file you created. Paste the model diagram into
your report.</li>

<li>A screen capture of your working GUI application (in the report only).</li>


<li>The source files for your application. In the report, also include all
files you wrote (if you based your application on a tutorial, etc., omit any
large code sections from the lab report that aren't your own and note these.)  

<li>A simplified time log indicating how much time was spent by each team member
on which portions of the assignment.</li>

</ul>

<p>Submit this report to the instructor via email, zipping all your files into a single archive. Be sure to keep copies of all your files, in
case something gets lost; it may also be wise to keep a backup (<em>e.g.</em>, ssh the files to another system, such as
<b>bashful</b> or <b>people</b>).</p>
