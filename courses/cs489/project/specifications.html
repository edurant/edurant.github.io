title: "CS-489 Product Specification"

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The goal of this project is to develop a software package that derives 
information from program source files. This software tool will provide data to 
estimate and track the size of software development projects. Initially, this 
application will focus primarily on non-comment lines of code (NCLOC). Because 
the actual act of NCLOC counting can be made rather trivial with the proper 
coding standard <em>the goal of this project is to focus on the management and 
tracking aspects of this problem</em>. (For example, as we are counting lines, a 
format that puts all braces on separate lines will generate a higher LOC count 
than a more condensed standard format. There are more sophisticated methods 
that address these issues, such as counting expressions and statements, but 
these are significantly more complex and are beyond the scope of this project.) 
In fact, a properly designed code counter can be easily reconfigured to count to 
multiple coding standards and languages by separating the standard/language 
aspect from the actual counter. <em>Your project will be required to support 
such a mechanism.</em> (Hint: Use a Line of Code base class or similar 
mechanism.)</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Because part of the software engineering process is the elicitation
and definition of requirements, this specification is purposely vague in
some details and may be missing other relevant information. Please consult
your client (the professor) for any needed clarification.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgement</h2>

<p>This project is based on an assignment developed by Dr. Welch,
which, in turn, draws on work done by Watts Humphrey of the <a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/">Software
Engineering Institute</a>. Elements of this project are taken from Humphrey's
text on the Team Software Process (TSP). Humphrey has written several software
engineering books, including two on the Personal
Software Process (PSP) and one on the Team Software Process.</p>

<h2>Cycle 1 specification</h2>

<p>The program information application analyzes a specified set of source files.
You may chose to analyze either C++, Java, or C# files (your analyzed language choice does
not need to be the same as your coding language choice; indeed, your application will
be extensible so that modifications allowing analysis of source files from a wide variety of languages will be
possible. When analyzing C++, you must support both ".h" and ".cpp" files. The user specifies which files are to
be analyzed. Note that the files may be in more than one directory, and
there could thus be more than one file with the same name.</p>

<p>The number of non-comment lines of code in each file is to be counted
and reported, by file and in aggregate. At a minimum, the "//' comment
style must be supported.</p>

<p>The analysis results should be displayed on the screen and, upon user
request, saved as a text file containing file names and size (NCLOC) for
each file, and the total size for all files.</p>

<p>The software package must operate properly in the Windows XP
environment; it is expected that that an appropriate GUI framework will be used
(e.g., MFC for C++, Swing for Java, Windows Forms for C#). Student teams wishing to use other frameworks should get 
permission from the professor before doing so.</p>

<p>The following features are optional additions for Cycle 1:

<ul>

<li>Handling stylized versions of "/* */" comments, in which the "/*" is the
first non-whitespace element on a line and the "*/" is on a line by itself
(perhaps with whitespace).</li>

<li>Reporting of internal documentation size (comment LOC) as well as program
size. NOTE: This should not count white space lines.</li>

<li>Printed report of program information, using standard "print"
and "print preview" mechanisms.</li>

<li>Maintain history files of previous length analyses containing a list
of file paths and length metrics so that code size change reports can be automatically
generated.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h2>Cycle 2 specifications</h2>

<p>In this cycle, all the Cycle 1 capabilities must be retained. In addition,
the program information application must also determine the size (NCLOC)
of individual classes. This new information includes
the total size of each class (definition, all member functions, etc.),
the number of methods (member functions) in each class, and the average size for all 
the methods in each class.</p>

<p>The various analysis options (at least the file LOC and object/method
LOC) must be individually selectable by the user, and any or all may be
chosen at one time.</p>

<p>[Implementation note: the specification does not require you to write a 
parser for the analyzed language. It is permissible to use other techniques (such as 
embedding special comments {perhaps using JavaDoc with a coding standard that includes
comment formatting} to identify sections of source code. Hint: Using comments isn't 
necessary if you use a coding standard that rigorously specifies formatting, perhaps
including indentation, columns for braces when ending a method, etc.</p>

<p>The following features are optional additions for cycle 2:

<ul>

<li>Categorizing classes and/or methods by type (e.g., data handling, calculation,
logic/control, etc.).</li>

<li>Preparation of a set of "code review" source file print-outs which might
use colors to highlight comments or other code aspects.</li>

<li>Compute the actual NCLOC for each individual member function.</li>

<li>Maintain history files similar to those of Cycle 1.</li>

</ul>
</p>
