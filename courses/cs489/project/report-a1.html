title: "CS-489 Cycle 1 Analysis Report"
---

<p>The Cycle 1 analysis document should contain the following items:
<ol>

<li>Title page, including project name, team designation, and names of team members.</li>
<li>Table of contents.</li>
<li>Project (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2) requirements:</li>

	<ul>
	<li>Include any additions or clarifications elicited from the client.</li>
	<li>Include any optional requirements that you plan to attempt.</li>
	<li>Consider all of the categories outlined in the text and use a format similar to 
	those used in the
	Software Development Lab.</li>
	</ul>

<li>Use cases:</li>

	<ul>
	<li>High-level use cases for Cycle 2 requirements.</li>
	<li>Expanded essential use cases for Cycle 1 requirements.</li>
	<li>Include use case diagrams in your CASE Tool model and use case text in Microsoft Word.</li>
	</ul>

<li>Domain model:</li>

	<ul>
	<li>Include concepts, attributes, and associations.</li>
	<li>Document in one or more UML class diagrams drawn using a CASE tool.</li>
	</ul>

<li>System behavior:</li>

	<ul>
	<li>System sequence diagrams (CASE Tool), with use case references or text.</li>
	<li>Contracts for system operations (e.g., Word).</li>
	</ul>

<li>Glossary of terms:</li>

	<ul>
	<li>Similar in concept to that described in the textbook, though
	you may use any reasonable format.</li>
	<li>This glossary should be expanded and updated throughout the project.</li>
	</ul>

<li>Issue list:</li>

	<ul>
	<li>A list of questions to be asked, decisions to be made, topics to be investigated, etc.</li>
	<li>This list is to be maintained throughout the project; items should be marked
	"complete", dated, and explained when they are resolved, but not removed from the list.</li>
	</ul>

<li>Project management information (see <a href="../process.html">process
details</a>):</li>

	<ul>
	<li>Time spent on the project to date, by team member and phase. (It is likely
	that all the effort to date will be in the "planning" phase of Cycle 1
	of the project.) Include summary
	totals by team member, by phase, and for the entire project.</li>
	<li>Copies of the time tracking sheets (or other form of recording) of all
	team members.</li>
	</ul>

<li>Your CASE tool model file.</li>

</ol>
