## Project overview

The course lab project is a team software development effort implemented
in two iterations or cycles. The project phases correspond to those discussed
in lecture and result in a completed software product, associated documentation,
and other deliverables. (Although some details of this project differ from
those of previous years, you may still find some useful information in
prior team reports. See the links above.)

## Acknowledgement

This project is based on an assignment developed by Dr. Welch, which, in turn, was heavily influenced by the work of Watts
Humphrey of the <a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/">Software Engineering
Institute</a>. Specifically, some elements have been based on Humphrey's
text <cite>The Team Software Process</cite> (TSP).

## Project deliverables

In the course of the project, the following items must be delivered. Due
dates are given in the <a href="../outline.html">course
outline</a>.

### Cycle 1
* <a href="report-a1.html">Analysis document</a>
* <a href="report-d1.html">Design document</a>
* <a href="report-f1.html">Cycle 1 final report</a>
	
### Cycle 2

* <a href="report-f2.html">Final project report</a>

## Assignment reports

All reports are to be emailed in an approved format (e.g., .docx, .pdf).
Because of space and time limitations, the emphasis 
should be on clarity and information content rather than fancy formatting or 
flashy graphics.  The emailed submission will consist of a single Zip file 
containing all necessary files.  Be sure to keep copies of all your files and
your submittal email, in case something gets lost.
