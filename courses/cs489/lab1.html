title: "CS-489 Lab 1: C++ or Java Referesher and the Personal Software Process"
---

<p align="center">by Dr. Durant
<br/>This lab is based on a lab developed by Dr. Welch.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of this lab is to refresh your knowledge of C++ or Java and to gain
some familiarity with the <a href="process.html">Personal
Software Process</a>.</p>

<h2>Activities</h2>

<p>This is an <b>individual</b> lab; each student is to submit a separate
report. However, you are encouraged to discuss your work with others and
to consult with the instructor as necessary.</p>

<p>In this lab, you will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a small C++ or Java program using an integrated development environment</li>
<li>Track your time by development phase</li>
<li>Record information regarding defects found during development</li>
<li>Report on your results</li>
</ul>

<h2>Detailed instructions</h2>

<p>If you have difficulties with any part of the lab, consult the instructor
for assistance. The basic sequence is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Review the C++ or Java language if you are out of practice.
Ask your instructor if you have any questions.</li>

<li>Review the material provided on the <a href="process.html">Personal
Software Process</a>.</li>

<li>Sketch the design for a small C++ or Java program with at least one user-defined
class. The class should have a constructor, destructor (C++ only; include a finalize
method for your Java class only if needed), copy constructor (clone method for Java class),
an assignment operator (C++ only), and other member functions. For example, you might
implement a bank account class with member functions to make deposits and
withdrawals and to print the current balance.</li>


<li>Implement the program using an IDE, such as Eclipse or Visual Studio.  It is recommended that you use a Windows tool (not a Linux tool) since we will be using the Windows version of Enterprise Architect, our CASE tool, later in the term.</li>

<li>Submit the lab report (details below).</li>

</ol>

<h2>Lab report</h2>

The lab report should consist of the following:

<ul>

<li>A brief description of any problems you encountered or questions you have
regarding the lab.</li>


<li>Your fully documented source code.  See my documentation examples.
Although these examples are done in C++, a similar level of documentation is expected for Java.
For Java, please follow the use Javadoc formatting.
For C++, it is recommended, but not required, that you use the NDOC format, but
Javadoc and doxygen are also acceptable and commonly used documentation formats for C++ code.</li>

<li>Your PSP time and defect logs including a summary of the amount of time
spent in each phase and the total number of defects injected and removed
in each phase.</li>

</ul>

<p>Submit this report to the instructor via email, zipping all your files into a single archive.</p>
