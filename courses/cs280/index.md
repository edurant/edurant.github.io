## Textbook

No textbook is required for this course. However, each student is required to purchase a FOX11 kit with keypad and display. These are available in the bookstore and will be used in CS-384 and perhaps other classes in the junior and senior years.

You will need a copy of a Motorola
reference guide, which will be distributed in class. It is also available in PDF, as is a more comprehensive reference manual:

* MC68HC11 E Series Programming Reference Guide
* MC68HC11 Reference Manual
