title: "Dr. Durant: CS-384 Design of Operating Systems: Term Paper"
---

## Overview

The term paper is a research report on some aspect (your choice) of the design of
operating systems, and is an individual effort. The format should be compatible with
guidelines taught in MSOE composition courses (EN-131 and EN-132), and include appropriate
bibliographic references. No specific length is set, though it seems unlikely that a
reasonable job could be done in less than 15-20 pages of &quot;double spaced&quot; body
text.

You are expected to research your topic in some depth. Your sources <b>must</b>
include technical journals, books, and similar &quot;reputable&quot; sources. While you
are encouraged to use internet/web resources as well, be careful to assess the quality of
the information you find. Be especially critical in evaluating information provided by
someone with a vested interest (e.g., the vendor of a particular operating system or
software package). Your treatment of your chosen topic should extend beyond any related
material in the textbook.

A __preliminary outline and bibliography__ is to be submitted before the
full paper; due dates are shown in the course schedule.

The final paper must be submitted in Word, PDF, or other agreed upon 
format via email and will be posted on the Web.

Each student will give a short oral presentation, covering the highlights of the term
paper content.

## Example topics

* Processor allocation and CPU scheduling, multi-processor support
* Processes, threads, kernel threads, and associated implementation issues
* Comparisons of different operating systems
* Windows XP graphics architecture
* File systems, or a particular file system
* Network queuing theory and its application to computer system models
* Scheduling systems
* Security and protection
* Virtual machine operating systems
* Embedded systems issues

Many past students have found the term paper to be a
valuable and enjoyable project. It may be difficult to choose a topic early in the course,
when many operating system subjects have not yet been discussed. You are encouraged to read ahead
in the textbook, to visit the library, to surf the Web, and to consult the instructor.

## Outline Format

There are a few good formats for outlines, but the most common is the
classic I-A-1-a format. (I-a-1 is not an acceptable format.)

<pre> I. Top level
II. Another top level item
    A. Second Level
    B. Continued
       1. More
       2. Yet more
          a. And more yet
          b. Et cetera</pre>

There is also the I-A-1-a)-(1)-(a)-i) format (University of Chicago
Press), but this is not as common. I am not too particular about the
"line up the periods" rule, but you should do this if it is easily
supported by your word processing or text layout software. Generally,
the rule that there must be 0, or 2 or more (but not 1) subpoints is a
very good one, but you could make an argument for breaking it in certain
situations.

## Types of References

Each term paper should have at least a few journal article
(or perhaps conference paper) references, which contain the most recent
information available that has been peer reviewed. Newer papers provide
depth and, especially, currency that is hard to find in books. Older
papers may be appropriate, especially when they are seminal (from the
time of the origin of the idea and strongly influencing further
development).

## Citations and Quotation Marks

Additionally, as you write your papers, be mindful of when to use
quotation marks and when to cite a work. Almost exclusively, you should
be using your own words. When it is particularly advantageous to borrow
the words from one of your sources, you must put the borrowed text in
quotation marks as a sign of giving proper credit to the author of those
words. In the quotation you may also want to take advantage of ellipsis
(...) to indicate removed words and brackets to indicate inserted words.
You must provide a citation in several situations, including...

* direct quote (as described above)
* conclusion reached by another source, e.g.,
  <blockquote>According to Durant \[7\], there are no feasible solutions to the
  halting problem.</blockquote>
* source provides support and background, e.g,.
  <blockquote>Several authors propose solutions to the instruction restart problem
  \[3, 18\], but only Corner's method \[5\] meets the second of our
  criteria.</blockquote>

The bracketed numbers are from the
IEEE citatation format \[1\] -- you may use any appropriate, standard citation format.

Failure to follow these guidelines is an 
ethical breach and is considered plagiarism. You __must__ give credit to those whose 
thoughts and ideas you are borrowing for your paper.
