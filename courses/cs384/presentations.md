title: "Dr. Durant: CS-384 Design of Operating Systems: Term Paper Presentations"
---

<p>This assignment counts for 20% of your term paper grade.
You have up to 10 minutes to make your presentation. A good presentation
will generally give a brief overview of your research, present a particular
aspect in some detail, and then summarize your findings.</p>

## Guidelines

* The 10-minute time limit applies to your presentation (introduction through
    conclusion/summary). Presenters exceeding this limit risk being unceremoniously
    cut off.
* Be ready to set up quickly.
* The professor will allow questions as time permits. You are evaluated both
    on how well your presentation anticipates questions (not leaving key facts
    out) and, time permitting, how you answer any questions.
* Questions may come from either the professor or members of the audience
    and will be reserved until the presenter concludes.
* Grading will be based on
    <a href="presentationRubric.pdf">this rubric</a>.
