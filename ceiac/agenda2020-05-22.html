    <td>Student feedback: Senior debriefing summary
        <ul>
            <li>11 seniors completed the CE senior debriefing survey from 4/8 to 4/30.</li>
            <li>All 7 SO (student outcome) ratings, in both student success and assistance of program, exceeded the 70% threshold for &quot;adequately&quot; or better.</li>
            <li>The worst case was SO3, where 2 out of 11 students rated the outcome below benchmark in both success and assistance.
                <ul>
                    <li>SO3: &quot;an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences&quot;</li>
                    <li>Comments include that presentations are only done in freshman studies sequence and information security [N.B.: they're done elsewhere, including in senior design]</li>
                    <li>Some students would like more coursework (dedicated or integrated) in this area, but the majority rate and comment positively on the current situation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Many (and universally) positive comments on the CE faculty.</li>
