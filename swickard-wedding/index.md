## Gifts

Your presence on our special day was the greatest gift of all. We deeply appreciate your love and support as we embarked on this journey together.

We chose not to register for gifts as our home is already filled with all the essentials we need. If you still wish to express your goodwill in the form of a gift, we are humbled by the sentiment.

Instead of traditional gifts, you may consider making a charitable donation in our name, treating us to a memorable experience like a dinner, or supporting our honeymoon (we're going to Argentina and Antarctica in January). However, please remember that there is no obligation; your well wishes and presence are more than enough.

Once again, thank you for being a part of our lives and our celebration. We were delighted to see everyone who joined us at our wedding.
