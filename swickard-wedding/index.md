Sunday, July 9, 2023 — Milwaukee, WI

Invitations were mailed in early April and RSVPs requested by May 9.

## Photos

We had our first [photo session](https://www.happygnomephotography.com/ClientGalleries/Eric-and-Scott/) with our photographer on May 25.

## Rehearsal Dinner

Our out-of-town guests, wedding party, and close family received invitations to our rehearsal dinner at 6 PM on Saturday, July 8 at [Onesto's](https://onestomke.com/) ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/xjsHmUtSTwKb1FfU7)) upstairs event space. This is the final evening of Summerfest, so traffic and parking may be very challenging; you may want to take an Uber or find parking in the Cathedral Square area and take the streetcar.

## Wedding and Reception

Our wedding and reception will be held at 4 PM on Sunday, July 9 at [Pritzlaff 325](https://pritzlaffevents.com/) ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/evad1c8pV1Kxz9HH6)). Please enter via the &ldquo;tunnel&rdquo; along Saint Paul Avenue located adjacent to the eastbound streetcar station.

## Hotel Recommendations

There are many great options nearby including the [Saint Kate](https://www.saintkatearts.com/) and [Drury Plaza](https://www.reservations.com/hotel/drury-plaza-hotel-downtown-milwaukee-wi). The Saint Kate recently advertised 20% off of a 2+-night stay with free parking if you request the “Summer Savings” package.

## Attire

As we gather to celebrate this special day, we welcome you to express your personal style. While we some guests may lean towards formal wear, we truly encourage you to dress in a way that makes you feel most comfortable and festive. Be it a creative spin on a traditional attire or something entirely unique, all expressions of style are welcome.

For our part, we will be donning custom tuxedos in the wedding colors of charcoal and navy. We look forward to seeing you in your chosen attire as we come together in celebration and style.

## Gifts

Your presence on our special day is the greatest gift of all. We deeply appreciate your love and support as we embark on this journey together.

We have chosen not to register for gifts as our home is already filled with all the essentials we need. If you still wish to express your goodwill in the form of a gift, we are humbled by the sentiment.

Instead of traditional gifts, you may consider making a charitable donation in our name, treating us to a memorable experience like a dinner, or supporting our honeymoon (we're considering Austrailia and Iceland). However, please remember that there is no obligation; your well wishes and presence are more than enough.

Once again, thank you for being a part of our lives and our celebration. We can't wait to see you at the wedding.
