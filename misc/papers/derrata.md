title: "Dissertation Errata and Clarifications: Hearing Aid Fitting with Genetic Algorithms"
---

* \[p. 5, KR\] Last paragraph, sentence beginning on line 4: While the bone and soft tissue feedback paths are important, another important feedback path in many aids is through the air, whether through a vent or due to a poor physical fit. The air path is arguably the primary feedback path in many hearing aids.

* \[p. 8, KR\] First paragraph in Section 2.2: Thresholds on an audiogram are plotted in hearing level (HL), not in dB SPL. HL is offset from dB SPL by a frequency-specific value such that 0 dB HL represents (50%?) detection thresholds for a particular set of normal, young listeners. The HL origin is often calibrated to standard 2 cc coupler measurements.

* \[p. 15, SAM\] Last sentence of footnote 9: Reference 28: The author's name is spelled differently in the body ("Hollstien") than in the citation ("Hollstein"). I no longer have the image of the original dissertation to verify the correct spelling. What are normally reliable sources are nearly evenly split on the spelling. In any case, I apologize to Dr. Holst... for the misspelling.

* \[p. 40, KR\] First sentence of Section 4.2.2: It would be more appropriate to say that gain margin is an objective measure of feedback cancellation (not management) system performance. "Feedback management" typically refers to gain reduction methods, not more sophisticated adaptive methods such as those discussed by Maxwell and Zurek \[37\] and used in Experiment 1.

* \[p. 61, SAM\] Opening of second paragraph: The appropriate reference is "Byrne and Walker \[5\]".

* \[p. 67, SAM\] Second sentence of Section 7.3.1: "Diversity is initially between 12.5 and 14.5..."

* \[p. 69, SAM\] Final paragraph, end of first sentence on line 3: "...majority of rounds."

* \[p. 71, SAM\] Caption of Figure 7.3, sentence beginning on 2nd line: "Rational" should have been used to describe the observers instead of "objective".

* \[p. 106, EAD\] section 10.2, 2nd paragraph: "proposes" should be "propose"

* \[p. 120, EAD\] Index - There should not be head entries for "HRTF" and "JND".
