## Abstract

By extending the relationship between the DWT and the DFT over **_C_** to the
NTT over *GF(p)*, we find that the analog of the DWT is a wavelet transform in
*GF(p)*. System representations of this transform, such as filter banks,
2-circulant matrices, and a unitary transformation matrix are summarized. A
detailed example with supporting MATLAB code is also given.

## Overview

This paper presents a brief theoretical treatment of cyclic wavelet transforms
in *GF(p)*, where *p* is a Fermat prime \[1\]. Related practical and theoretical
issues, such as principal square roots in *GF(p)* are also discussed. A detailed
example is worked and MATLAB code is provided.
