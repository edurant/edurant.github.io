## Abstract

The perceptual tuning problem is encountered in many fields. It is the problem
of tuning a system, which may have many interacting parameters, to provide
output which is good as perceived by the system's users. The system may be a
radio, hearing aid, personal digital assistant, frozen custard machine, etc.
Approaches to the perceptual tuning problem may be judged on ease of use, speed,
robustness and generality, among other qualities.

In this research, we investigate algorithms and techniques to enable genetic
algorithms (GAs) to be used successfully in a variety of perceptual tuning
problems. To validate this research, we apply it to a difficult problem which
has a rich history of research into its many aspects, and to which a variety of
tuning algorithms have been applied with varying success. This problem is
DSP-based hearing aid fitting.

Fitting modern DSP-based hearing aids, which have numerous parameters, is a
challenge for even the experienced audiologist. Simple but proven fitting
rationales are used, limiting the prescribed setting to a subset of the device's
capabilities. We will first investigate whether a genetic algorithm can guide a
hearing-impaired subject towards perceptually good feedback canceller parameters
in everyday conditions when used with his or her hearing aid prescription. Many
previous studies of GAs for perceptual tuning \[1, \2] and other adaptive
hearing aid fitting methods \[3\] were conducted in the laboratory, limiting
their applicability to real-world use.

We will use the results of this first investigation to extend our procedure to
general hearing aid fitting, including frequency selective amplification and
compression. Our approach will use prescriptive settings from existing
rationales for linear and compressive aids as starting points, much as Neuman
*et al.* \[3\] did for hearing aids with linear amplification. Linear rationales
have been shown to work well for basic hearing aids, but compressive rationales
remain a subject of major debate \[4\].
