<h4>
In the late 1800s, Hanover Street (now south 3rd St.) was a showplace
of the South Side.  These are three variations on the Victorian Italianate
style, and were all built in the early 1870s.  The house at 821 S. 3rd St.
was built last and (originally) had the greatest ornamentation.  The owners
were Emil Durr (821, lumber dealer), Emil Schneider (813, liquor wholesaler),
and Heliodore Hilbert (803, civil engineer, president of the Common Council,
and city treasurer).
