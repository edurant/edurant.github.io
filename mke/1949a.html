Lustron House</a><br>
3205 N. 82nd St.<br>
1949<br>
</h3>
<h4>
An excellent remaining example of a post-World War II
attempt at affordable housing -- a porcelain-coated
steel panel house.  This is one of about 14 remaining
Lustrons on the northwest side of Milwaukee, and
is in almost the exact same form as when it was
purchased for $8995 in 1949.  The 1000-sq. ft.
(two bedroom) homes had nearly every component made of steel.
The houses were in big demand nationwide, but the company
was only able to supply 2500 of the 20000 desired before
going out of business.
