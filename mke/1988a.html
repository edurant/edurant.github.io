This is the home of the professional sports teams the
<i>Milwaukee Bucks</i> (basketball) and <i>Milwaukee
Admirals</i> (hockey).  The exterior has over 110,000
square feet of rose-colored cornelian granite and is topped
with leaded copper.  The venue, which holds 20,000 visitors,
honors Milwaukee industrialist Harry Lynde Bradley, co-founder
of the <a href=1962b.html>Allen-Bradley Co.</a>  It was a
gift to the community from Bradley's daughter, Jane Pettit, and
her husband, Lloyd.
