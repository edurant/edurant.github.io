<h4>
This 950-foot-long building was designed by architects Miller & Waltz
to serve as a main receiving and distribution center for mail.
The materials are mostly concrete faced with Lannon stone slabs
of varying thicknesses.  The use of exposed, weathering, rusty steel
was the first in a downtown building.
<BR><P>It has recently been reported that the
U.S. Postal Service plans to replace the building.
