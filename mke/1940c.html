<h4>
With a distinctive industrial "moderne" appearance, these bridge houses
overlook the Milwaukee River and the Cherry Street bridge.  The bridge
houses were built under the Federal Works Agency's Public
Works Administration, during the President Franklin Roosevelt era.  They were
restored in 1990.
