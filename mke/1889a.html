<h4>
The original structure was designed by Edward Townsend Mix
as the Plymouth Congregational Church.  In 1936 the Scottish
Rite Masons acquired the building and hired Herbert Tullgren
to remodel it.  The street facades were faced with carved and cut
limestone.  The foundation and the east wall are the only original
portions of the original structure still visible.
