St. Boniface Episcopal Church (Mequon)</a><br>
3906 W. Mequon Rd.<br>
2001<br>
</h3>
<h4>
This new, nearly $2.6 million church, is clad almost completely
in copper sheeting.  It was designed by Jim Shields of
Hammel, Green & Abrahamson, and replaces the former building,
constructed in phases between the 1950s and the 1980s.
The interior includes Douglas fir ceilings, cedar pews,
Vermont slate floor, and a limestone altar.
