<br>Schlitz Brewing Company Buildings</a><br>
235 W. Galena St.<br>
1870's<br>
</h3>
<h4>
Many of the defunct Jos. Schlitz brewery buildings still exist and are
used as offices for other firms.  Schlitz was once the largest
Milwaukee brewery and the second-largest in the nation.  The
cream city brick
building shown has a onion dome on top of a glazed lantern.
The building originally had an identical tower on the north end.
