It's probably obvious where I stood for the Lakefront photo -- on the landfill area
next to the seawall (in Veterans Park), off of the Art Center.  For the NW of Downtown shot, I was on the
pedestrian overpass above the Park Freeway (when the freeway was still there).  It was a little tricky shooting through
the fence!  For the one from the south, I was at the north end of Bay View Park, near
E. Oklahoma Ave. and S. Superior St.
