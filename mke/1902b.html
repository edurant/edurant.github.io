During construction, after 4700 worker-hours of labor, this
building collapsed and had to be restarted.  It was the first
reinforced concrete building in Milwaukee, and features a limestone
entrance on Michigan St. (left) and on the entire Jefferson St.
side.  Designed by H.J. Esser, it is faced with red brick.
