<h4>
Philanthropist Evan Helfaer donated this theater in memory of his late wife,
Marion.  The brown brick building is accented with concrete bands.
The roof is made of weathering steel, which initially rusts and protects itself
against further deterioration.  The building includes a 226-seat theater.
