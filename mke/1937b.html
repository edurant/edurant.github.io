An outstanding "moderne" design, made of smooth-finish
limestone, is the home of the Badger Mutual (Fire)
Insurance Co.  The company's name is seen in
low-relief letters above the door.  
The architect was Herbert Tullgren, who's
company (Martin Tullgren & Sons) had many
important contributions during this era.
