<br>Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church</a><br>
605 S. 4th St.<br>
1849<br>
</h3>
<h4>
One of Milwaukee's oldest churches, it was designed by the same architect
(Victor Schulte) who drew the plans for
<a href=1847a.html>St. Mary's</a> and
<a href=1847b.html>St. John's</a>.  The octagonal steeple was added in 1862.
It is, like Schulte's other two churches, an example of the German
Zopfstil style.
