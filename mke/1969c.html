<h4>
Now called the <i>Marcus Center for the Performing Arts</i>, this is the home
of such groups as the Milwaukee Symphony and Milwaukee Ballet.  The
original Italian travertine stone cladding deteriorated in less
that 20 years and necessitated replacement with Biezanz
limestone.  The building contains several theaters.
