Milwaukee Intermodal Station (Amtrak Passenger Station)</a><br>
433 W. St. Paul Ave.<br>

</h3>
<h4>
This facility was needed after both primary railroad stations
were torn down (<i>Milwaukee Road</i> in 1965, and <i>Chicago & Northwestern</i>
in 1968).  The facades include semicircular arches with dark tinted
glass windows surrounded by glazed brown brick.  The 125 foot steel
tower holds an electronic bell.
<BR><BR>
It was rebuilt as the Milwaukee Intermodal Station in 2007.
