"About the roof design of the Annason. - The original design was to have a
dance floor there for the tenants with a tile floor for the dance area.
Both elevators came to the roof.   The 2 pylons were designed to hold beacons
of light as a decoration. Unfortunately, the beacon lights had
to be eliminated because of airline rules and regulations would have needed
a full-time operator on the site paid by Annason.   Dancing was
also eliminated due to weather uncertainty.  Originally, there was to be
a hoist outside of the rear stairs to haul oversized furniture to each floor
instead of using the elevators."
