Captain Frederick Pabst Mansion</a><br>
2000 W. Wisconsin Ave.<br>
1890<br>
</h3>
<h4>
Probably the most significant residential landmark in Milwaukee,
this mansion was designed by George Ferry of Ferry & Clas.
The conservatory at the east end of the house was originally
an exhibit pavilion for the display of Pabst (Brewery) products at the
World Columbian Exposition in Chicago, 1893.  Pabst was originally
a ship captain and married Maria Best, the daughter of the founder
of Best Brewery.  Pabst eventually became the company president,
changing the name to
<a href=1880a.html>Pabst.</a>
His sons, <a href=1906b.html>Gustave</a>
and <a href=1891d.html> Fred Jr.</a> also built mansions of their
own.  The <a href=1895b.html>Pabst Theater</a> is a legacy to the Pabsts.
Now look at the
