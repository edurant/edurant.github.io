<h4>
With the entrance still decorated with the Schlitz Brewery saloon globe,
this was
a companion to the Schlitz Palm Garden downtown.  It originally
housed a barroom, cafe, bowling alleys and barbershop.  It is built of 
tan brick and Bedford limestone.  Schlitz ran many neighborhood
taverns, including <a href=1890f.html>this one</a>.
