Milwaukee Harbor<br>

</h3>
<h4>
This main navigation light in the Milwaukee Harbor was formerly
operated by rotating four-person Coast Guard crews who lived in the structure on 
21-day shifts (every 28 days).  In 1963 the operation was automated 
via remote control.  The 61' (5 story) light has a range of about 14 miles.
