<h4>
Now owned by neighboring Marquette University, this 4-story building was
originally planned to be 8 stories tall.  In the 1950s such consideration
was again made, but never carried out.  Two 4-story blocks extend to the
sidewalk partially enclosing a courtyard.  The Gothic styling includes
two-color terra cotta facing.
