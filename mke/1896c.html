<h4>
This French Chateau structure is actually two joined buildings.
Francis Bloodgood built the northern half, and his initial along with
that of his wife's maiden name (Hawley, after who's family Hawley Road was named)
appears in a terra-cotta monogram above the entrance.  The south half was built
by Mary Hawley.
