<h4>
This important Art Deco structure was built by Harry Grant,
former owner and publisher of the <i>Milwaukee Journal</i>.
There are 8 apartments on each floor and two penthouses.
Herbert Tullgren designed the apartments of two stories each.
The elevators stop only on the odd-numbered floors, to minimize
noise on the bedroom floors.  The design was patented by Tullgren
(U.S. Patent 1,896,734).
