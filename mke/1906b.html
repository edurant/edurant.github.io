Gustave G. Pabst Mansion</a><br>
2230 N. Terrace Ave.<br>
1906<br>
</h3>
<h4>
Gustave was the oldest son of
<a href= 1890b.html>Captain Frederick Pabst</a>, of Pabst
Brewery fame.  This home, overlooking Lake Michigan, was designed
by the same firm, Ferry & Clas, that designed the Captain's home.
The limestone ashlar facade is trimmed with wrought bronze grilles.
The columns were cut from single blocks of stone after Mrs. Pabst
was said to be disappointed with the original sectioned columns.
