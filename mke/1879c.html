<br>Francis Hinton House</a><br>
1229-1231 N. Prospect Ave.<br>
1879<br>
</h3>
<h4>
Legend has it that this house blocked the view from <a href=1874d.html>
Jason Downer's house</a>, thus creating a feud.  Downer reportedly
retaliated by building another house to block Hinton's view of the
lake (at 1223 N. Prospect).
