National Soldier's Home</a><br>
Wood, Wisconsin<br>
1869<br>
</h3>
<h4>
Four such homes for disabled soldiers were created by Congress in
1866.  In addition to Wood, Wisconsin, they are located at
Augusta, ME, Hampton, VA and Dayton, OH.  The main building was
designed by Edward Townsend Mix in the Gothic revival style.  The
3-color slate work on the mansard roof is outstanding.
