This limestone and brick building served as the general office,
central car house, and terminal station for 
<a href=1898a.html>The Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company (TMER&L).</a>
The cast bronze entrance features two medallions showing a horse-drawn
streetcar and an electric car.  The original 4-story building, designed
by Herman J. Esser, had a fifth floor added in 1926.  Originally, a street
car tunnel went through the building.
