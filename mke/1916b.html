<h4>
Said to be Frank Lloyd Wright's only important residential
project in Milwaukee
(Zimmermann) this house embodies Wright's prairie style elements
into a somewhat heavy massive look.  At the time he was working
on the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo as well.  The buff brick is combined
with cast concrete and leaded glass.  Wright was also producing
a line of <a href=1916a.html>pre-fab houses</a> at the same time.
