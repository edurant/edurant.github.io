<h4>
Originally called the <i>John Mariner Building</i>,
it was the first building in the city to have central
air conditioning (this <i>was</i> 1937!).
It was named after the man who built the
<a href=1930c.html>Mariner Tower</a>.  Architects
Eschweiler & Eschweiler designed the building which
features smooth limestone decorated with "speed-line"
ribs.  The six-story structure is a good example of
"Moderne" design.
