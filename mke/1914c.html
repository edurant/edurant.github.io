A.F. Gallun (Pritzlaff) Mansion</a><br>
3000 E. Newberry Blvd.<br>
1914<br>
</h3>
<h4>
This Tudor mansion is built of Bedford limestone, with copper
gutters and a slate roof.  The owner was the president of the
Gallun Tannery.  After Gallun's death, the home was
inherited by his daughter, wife of hardware store executive
John Pritzlaff Sr.  Suffering from years of decay, it is now restored
to its original beauty.
