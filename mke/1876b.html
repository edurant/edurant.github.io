<br>Collins/Elwell Residence</a><br>
1363 N. Prospect Ave.<br>
1876<br>
</h3>
<h4>
Gilbert Collins built this Victorian mansion, but it was first occupied by
his daughter and her husband.  The unusual roofline
(including chiseled hip, pitched octagonal and half octagonal) resulted in
one third-floor room having 49 wall and ceiling surfaces.
