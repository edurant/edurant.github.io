<!--a href="1847b1.jpg"-->Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist
(St. John's Roman Catholic Church)</a><br>
802 N. Jackson St.<br>
1847<br>
</h3>
<h4>
One of the city's oldest churches, it originally had a much shorter
tower.  The present tower was added in 1892.  A devastating fire in
1935 destroyed much of the building.  Designed by Victor Schulte,
with the new tower by Ferry & Clas.

At left is the way the cathedral appeared for decades.
It was cleaned in 2001.
