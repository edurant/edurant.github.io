## Sci EL = Science Elective, 3+ credits
* BI102
* CH200, CH201, and successor classes
  * CH103 may not be used to satisfy any CE degree requirement
* Nearly all SC classes, check catalog or with advisor for exceptions
* PH
  * Most PH3xx classes
  * Doesn't include some non-calculus PH classes for some other majors
  * Any course listed for the physics minor counts as an Sci EL

## M/S EL = Math or Science Elective, 3+ credits
* Science defined above
* Math
  * Most MA3xx classes, but check catalog descriptions&mdash;e.g., Business or Nursing Statistics cannot count for credit for engineers
  * Any course listed for the math minor counts as a MA elective
  * Most non-required MA1xxx/MA2xxx classes are only for actuarial science majors and cannot be taken by engineers

## HU/SS EL
* Students must have a total of 5, and at least 2 in each category
* All numbered HU4\* and SS4\*. There is a button to show just these in Scheduler 2008.
* Should include anything listed in Scheduler 2008. Note that some classes are &ldquo;closed&rdquo; from the beginning; these are often classes that involve an overseas trip. The student needs to talk to the professor if they are interested in these classes.
* As of the 2016-&rsquo;17 catalog the restriction regarding a minimum Language II for HU credit is removed. Now, language courses follow the same HU elective rules as all other HU courses.

## Technical Elective = Tech EL = Prog EL = PE = Program Elective
* Anything on the &ldquo;CE&rdquo; column on the annual list published annually by the EECS department.
* This also includes any CS/EE/SE 3\*/4\* class that is not significantly duplicative of CE content.
* Can also take CE499/CS499/SE499/EE499 independent study (and similar numbers) for 1-3 credits.
* The complete UGR498x sequence consists of 6 credits and meets 2 CE PEs. Like the EE program, CE does not accept a partial UGR sequence for PE credit. However, see the note under the free elective.
* Certain sophomore level classes from other majors (that aren't significantly duplicative of CE content), including SE2811, SE2840, SE2800, SE2832
  * SE2040 may *not* be used as a program elective.
* Credits must add up. For example, if your curriculum version requires 6 PE credits, you might take an approved EECS class for 4 credits and a 2-credit CE499.

## Free Elective and GE (General Education) Elective
* Effective with a 2018-02-06 email to all CE students, the GE elective is now functionally the same as the free elective. This is based on new flexibility that MSOE granted the programs in designating classes as meeting the GE elective.
* The program has discretion on these since they are not used to meet any other department or ABET requirement.
* Generally anything that adds breadth&mdash;but not duplicative classes (e.g., Java intro from business school) or intro courses from other majors.
* Any PLTW classes except DE (digital electronics). $200 fee. <a href="https://msoe.s3.amazonaws.com/files/resources/2019-update-pltw-credit-app.pdf">Form, updated 2019.</a>
* Includes anything listed above, plus most sophomore level classes from other majors that aren't significantly duplicative of CE content, even if they don't count as a program elective.
* UGR498x I-II, without III, consists of 3 credits and meets one of these electives. This combination does not meet a CE PE.
* MA120 can be used per CE faculty decision on 2018-04-12.
