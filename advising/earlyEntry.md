title: "General 4+1 / Early Entry Policies"
---

This document summarizes key policies for 4+1 students, who typically begin graduate coursework in their 4th year, earn their undergraduate degree at the end of their 4th year, and complete their master's requirements about 1 year later.

# Early Entry Status

This section was copied from [Types of Acceptance section of the 2023-2024 Graduate Catalog](https://catalog.msoe.edu/content.php?catoid=30&navoid=891#Types_of_Acceptance):

> Conditional Acceptance of Early Entry Graduate Students
>
> Enrolled undergraduate students at MSOE may apply for early entry into select graduate programs during their junior year. Students who meet the admission criteria will then be notified that they are conditionally accepted and are eligible to continue in the program provided they maintain a minimum of a 3.0 cumulative undergraduate GPA in the remainder of their undergraduate courses and at least a 3.0 cumulative graduate GPA in the graduate courses they take as part of their undergraduate program. If these GPA requirements are met, students achieve full acceptance to the graduate program. If students do not meet those requirements they will either lose their conditional acceptance or transition to probationary acceptance, which they must resolve within two terms.

The application process for early entry status varies by program. MSML students should use MSOEs normal online application process. Students in CAECM apply directly to the graduate program director in the department. Please check with the program director with any questions.

Senior students in 20222023 who wish to complete the machine learning masters program will be eligible for early entry status and the reduced graduate tuition rate described below; going forward, students must apply for early entry status while they have junior standing.

> Early Entry Masters Degree Program Charges
>
> Early Entry Masters Degree programs offer the ability to complete both a bachelors and a masters degree in five years. Students may apply for a masters degree in their junior year and double-count up to 15 credits for both programs. These students are considered undergraduate until the degree is conferred.

Full-time students (12 credits or more) accepted into early entry programs are charged full-time undergraduate tuition rates and will receive undergraduate financial aid, even   though they may be taking graduate courses. If a student enrolls in more than 19 credits, they will be charged the undergraduate per-credit rate for any credits above 19.

MSOE amended its policies in January 2023 to increase the double-count limit to 16 credits. This will appear in the summer, 2023 revision of the graduate catalog.

Note that that undergraduate tuition and financial aid normally applies during the fourth year, specifically until the undergraduate degree is conferred. Once the undergraduate degree is conferred, graduate tuition applies.

Note that the above policy is restrictive to courses that are double counted towards an undergraduate requirement, usually an elective requirement. That is, students may not add graduate classes at undergraduate tuition while they have senior standing that do not simultaneously meet an undergraduate requirement. Such courses will be billed at the discounted graduate tuition rates  described below.

# Discounted Tuition Rate

Policy DRAFT 1/5/2023, to be added to [Student Financial Services section of 2023-24 Graduate Catalog](https://catalog.msoe.edu/content.php?catoid=30&navoid=898)

> Students in the graduate phase of an Early Entry Masters Degree program will be eligible for a discounted tuition rate. Students must have had their undergraduate degree conferred    in order to be considered for the discounted rate. Students must be in enrolled in at least 8 graduate-level credits per term and be meeting Satisfactory Academic Progress to receive the discounted tuition rate. Tuition will be charged on a per-credit basis by the Student Accounts Office. This discounted tuition rate only applies to the credits and courses required to complete the Masters Degree portion of the Early Entry Program. This discounted tuition rate is available for up to one year after conferral of the undergraduate degree.

In any cases where MSOEs offerings do not make it possible to enroll in at least 8 credits in a term, that restriction will be waived.

In any cases where MSOEs offerings do not make it possible to complete the masters degree within the 1 year deadline, the deadline will be extended by the minimum amount needed to make it possible to complete the degree.

The 20232024 graduate tuition rates for 4+1 students will be:
* Architectural Engineering and Civil Engineering 4+1 students  $560 per credit hour (as opposed to $1,400 per credit hour for non-4+1 graduate students)
* Engineering Management 4+1 students  $TBD per credit hour (as opposed to $1,160 per credit hour for non-4+1 graduate students)
* Machine Learning 4+1 students  $750 per credit hour (as opposed to $1,500 per credit hour for non-4+1 graduate students)

The above rates will be published in the summer, 2023 revision of the graduate catalog.

In future years:
* The architectural engineering and civil engineering 4+1 graduate tuition rate will be set at 40% of the regular tuition rate.
* The engineering management 4+1 graduate tuition rate will be set at TBD% of the regular tuition rate.
* The machine learning 4+1 graduate tuition rate will be set at 50% of the regular tuition rate.

# MSML Example Scenarios

## Scenario 1

Early entry student is taking 14 credits of classes that meet UG requirements including 1 course that also meets an MSML requirement. The student is also taking a 4-credit class that meets an MSML requirement but not an UG requirement. In this case the tuition for the semester in AY24 is $23,193 (UG FT) + 4  $750 (MSML class that doesnt meet an UG requirement) = $26,193 less any FT UG scholarships, etc.

## Scenario 2

Early entry student in final semester has only 11 required UG credits remaining, including an elective that can double-count for the MSML (under the 16-credit limit of graduate classes at UG tuition). The student is also taking a 4-credit class that meets an MSML requirement but not an UG requirement. In this case the tuition for the semester in AY24 is 11  $1,215 (UG PT) + 4  $750 (MSML class that doesnt meet an UG requirement) = $16,365 less any PT/prorated UG scholarships.
