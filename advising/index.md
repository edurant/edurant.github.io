## Advising policy

Computer engineering students see their advisors regularly to discuss academic and career plans and progress. In most terms, CE students must receive their advisors' clearance before registering; the online registration system enforces this. Beat the registration rush by contacting your advisor early in the quarter. You are welcomed and encouraged to meet with your advisor even in terms when it is not required to discuss your internship search, career goals, etc.

The policy is:
* Freshman or sophomore: meet with advisor every quarter
* Juniors in winter: meet with advisor
* Seniors in fall: meet with advisor
* Any GPA < 2.25: meet with advisor
* All others: advising not required, no hold will be automatically placed

"Freshman," etc. are based on credits and are defined in the &quot;Grade Level&quot; section of the &quot;Academic Regulations and Policies&quot; section of the <a href="https://catalog.msoe.edu/">MSOE Undergraduate Catalog</a>.

Remember that you can schedule your advising appointment before you receive your quarterly registration notice from the Registrar, so do not wait until the last week!

Starting in week 7 sign-up sheets with available advising slots are normally posted on your advisor's office door. Please sign up for one of these slots; signing up early will give you a wider choice of times. Some advisors will notify you of other appointment procedures (e.g., Outlook) or walk-in advising hours.
