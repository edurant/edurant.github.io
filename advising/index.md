## Advising policy

Computer engineering students see their advisors regularly to discuss academic and career plans and progress. In most terms, CE students must receive their advisors' clearance before registering; the online registration system enforces this. Beat the registration rush by contacting your advisor early in the quarter. You are welcomed and encouraged to meet with your advisor even in terms when it is not required to discuss your internship search, career goals, etc.

The policy is:
* First year students: meet with advisor every quarter
* Sophomores in fall and spring: meet with advisor
* Juniors in winter: meet with advisor
* Seniors in fall: meet with advisor
* Any GPA < 2.25: meet with advisor
* All others: advising not required, no hold will be automatically placed

"Sophomore," etc. are based on credits and are defined in the &quot;Grade Level&quot; section of the &quot;Academic Regulations and Policies&quot; section of the <a href="https://catalog.msoe.edu/">MSOE Undergraduate Catalog</a>.

Remember that you can schedule your advising appointment before you receive your quarterly registration notice from the Registrar, so do not wait until the last week!

You will be able to sign up for an advising appointment starting in week 7. You will be notified of your advisor's appointment sign-up procedures by the end of week 6.

## Semester transition
MSOE transitions to semesters in F'23.
* Students who start on the quarter system by F'22 will receive a customized transition plan around F'22 showing exactly which quarter and semester classes they need to take to earn their degree.
* Graduation
  * Students who were planning to graduate in a spring quarter will graduate in the corresponding spring semester.
  * Students who were planning to graduate in a fall quarter will graduate in the corresponding fall semester.
  * Students who were planning to graduate in a winter quarter will graduate in either fall or spring semester depending on their classes and credits remaining.
* As of 4/29/2022, standard transition plans are under review and are expected to be published soon. The CE faculty are looking into ways to increase elective options.

## Research and Graduate School Preparation

[This MSOE webpage](https://www.msoe.edu/academics/how-we-teach/labs-and-research/undergraduate-research/) outlines research opportunities for MSOE students including our undergraduate research program in which you work with a faculty member on a project over the course of a year and REUs, which are (usually) summer research experiences sponsored by the National Science Foundation that you can pursue at a variety of universities throughout the US. [This website](https://pathwaystoscience.org/) lists several REU and other opportunities. You can also [search for REU opportunities at the NSF's website](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp).
