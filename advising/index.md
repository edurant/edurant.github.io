# Advising policy

Computer engineering students see their advisors regularly to discuss academic and career plans and progress. In most terms, CE students must receive their advisors&rsquo; clearance before registering; the online registration system enforces this. You are welcomed and encouraged to meet with your advisor even in terms when it is not required to discuss your internship search, career goals, etc.

Advising appointments start in week 8. You will be notified of your advisor&rsquo;s appointment sign-up procedures in week 7.

# Semester transition
MSOE transitioned to semesters in F&rsquo;23. Students who started on the quarter system each received an Individual Transition Plan (ITP) exactly which quarter and semester classes they need to take to earn their degree.

## Special Elective Codes on Transition Plans

* ELC Free – Free Elective
* ELC HU – Humanities Course (AHT Art History, FNA Fine Arts, GER German, HST History, LIT Literature, PHL Philosophy, SPN Spanish, ARE3821/AE3321)
* ELC HUSS – Humanities or Social Science Course
* ELC PROG – Technical Computer Engineering Program Elective
* ELC SS – Social Science Course (ANT Anthropology, Economics, PSC Political Science, PSY Psychology, SOC Sociology, BUS2221/2222, BA1220/2220/2222)
* PLC HU – Placeholder for an HU course: This is an administrative tool we use to replicate ELC HU.
* PLC PROG – Placeholder for CPE Elective course: This is an administrative tool we use to replicate ELC PROG.
* PLC SS – Placeholder for an SS course: This is an administrative tool we use to replicate ELC SS.

Elective labels tagged with NONE are electives your advisor removed from the term as they balanced your course work.

# Curriculum Versions

If you you attended MSOE as an undergraduate through the semester transition, your individual transition plan replaces your official program curriculum.

# What to have available during the meeting with your advisor
* Your individual transition plan or a copy (physical or virtual) of the CE curriculum flowchart for your curriculum version marked with the courses you have successfully completed.
* Your preliminary plans for the next semester&rsquo;s schedule
* Your curriculum track (course list). Electronic copies are available at the links above. Or, go to <https://catalog.msoe.edu/> and select the catalog year that you first enrolled at MSOE.
* Any questions you may have

# Advisors
The MSOE Registrar keeps track of the advisor assigned to each student. If you are not sure who your advisor is, you can find out by following these steps.
  * Log in to <https://my.msoe.edu/ics>
  * Click Personal Info (next to your name in the top bar)
  * Click Academic Info within the My Info window
  * Your advisors will be listed in the first section.

The CE advisors are Profs. Livingston, Meier, Rothe, and Varnell. All their offices are located on the 3rd floor of the Library.

# Elective Options, Planned Offerings

Follow the link at [Registrar&rsquo;s Registration Resources](https://www.msoe.edu/academics/departments/registrar/#Registration) for

* School of Advanced Computing and ECBE electives, updated annually
* Summer classes, published approximately each February

# [CE Elective Rules, etc.](ceElectiveRules.html)

# Closed Sections
After your registration time, you may request entry into a closed section; every effort will be made to arrange a schedule with your on-track courses. Each department has its own policies for handling closed section requests.

* [Policies and forms for each department](https://www.msoe.edu/academics/departments/registrar/independent-study-and-closed-section/)

# Forms
Forms for declaring a minor, changing/adding a major, etc., are available on the [Registrar&rsquo;s website](https://www.msoe.edu/academics/departments/registrar/#Student%20Forms).

# Minors

MSOE and the School of Advanced Computing and ECBE department offer a variety of minors of interest to CE students. These include the following.

## [Data Science Minor](https://catalog.msoe.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=37&poid=1938)

(Not available to CS majors.)

For CEs (and other majors that have a year of required software design courses), this minor consists of:

* CSC2611 AI Tools (fall only, 3 credits)
* CSC2621 Intro to Data Science (every spring, plus fall of 2023, 3 credits)
* CSC4801 DS Practicum (spring only, 3 credits)

These courses must be taken in order, plus CSC4801 has a prerequisite of a statistics course such as MA262 or MTH2480. A practicum is an applied project course.

These classes meet CE program/technical (and free) elective requirements.

## [Electrical Engineering Minor](https://catalog.msoe.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=37&poid=1942)

(Not available to EE majors.)

CEs are already required to take many courses in the EE minor. To earn the minor, CEs follow the rule that they must take at least 6 credits not specifically required for their major. Note that these courses *can* be used to meet the CE program or free elective requirements.

## [Computer Engineering Minor](https://catalog.msoe.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=37&poid=1939)

(Not available to CE majors.)

## Math Minor

This applies to 2023 sophomores and to most 2023 juniors. Students further along in the curriculum should consult with their advisor if they did not complete the minor on the quarter system.

Distilling the new, semester-based, math minor requirements relative to the CE major requirements, CEs need to take 2 additional math classes to earn the math minor, which may be 0, 1, or 2 additional classes in total beyond their CE major requirements:

1. Fulfills CE free elective: MTH2130 Calculus III (3rd semester calculus) for 4 credits
1. For students *entering* on the semester system, fulfills MSOE General Education 6d elective: A 3000- or 4000- level class from an approved list. More options may be added. All of these have 3 credits and the prerequisites are from among CE-required classes or MTH2130 Calculus III:
   * MTH3340 Abstract Algebra with Applications
   * MTH3410 Applied Regression Analysis
   * MTH4130 Complex Analysis
   * MTH4150 Partial Differential Equations

The General Education 6d requirement applies to students who *enter* on the semester system. Students entering before the conversion (including freshmen in 2022-23) do not have a 6d elective and instead have humanities and social science credit counts that their advisors are ensuring are met on their transition plans.

# Two-degree Tracks
Two-degree tracks exist for CE in combination with CS, EE and SE. These tracks are laid out for 5 years, but students have accelerated the course sequence and finished one or two terms early. Please see your advisor or program director for more information.

# Internship and Job Search Resources
* Talk with your faculty and advisor
* [MSOE Career Connection Center](https://www.msoe.edu/the-msoe-advantage/career-connections-center/), including the Handshake system and annual Career Fair

# Research and Graduate School Preparation

[This MSOE webpage](https://www.msoe.edu/academics/how-we-teach/labs-and-research/undergraduate-research/) outlines research opportunities for MSOE students including our undergraduate research program in which you work with a faculty member on a project over the course of a year and REUs, which are (usually) summer research experiences sponsored by the National Science Foundation that you can pursue at a variety of universities throughout the US. [This website](https://pathwaystoscience.org/) lists several REU and other opportunities. You can also [search for REU opportunities at the NSF&rsquo;s website](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp).
