## Advising policy

Computer engineering students see their advisors regularly to discuss academic and career plans and progress. In most terms, CPE students must receive their advisors&rsquo; clearance before registering; the online registration system enforces this. Beat the registration rush by contacting your advisor early in the quarter. You are welcomed and encouraged to meet with your advisor even in terms when it is not required to discuss your internship search, career goals, etc.

You will be able to sign up for an advising appointment starting in week 7. You will be notified of your advisor&rsquo;s appointment sign-up procedures by the end of week 6.

## Semester transition
MSOE transitions to semesters in F&rsquo;23.
* [Semester Course Reference: Understanding your Transition Plan](semester-transition-ref.html)
* Students who start on the quarter system by F&rsquo;22 will receive a customized transition plan during F&rsquo;22 showing exactly which quarter and semester classes they need to take to earn their degree.
* For students who are *exactly* on the standard track, there are [standard transition plans](standardTransitionPlans.pdf). These are now only for historic interest; each student follows their personalized, signed plan.

## Curriculum Versions

If you you attended MSOE as an undergraduate through the semester transition, your individual transition plan replaces your official program curriculum.

## Research and Graduate School Preparation

[This MSOE webpage](https://www.msoe.edu/academics/how-we-teach/labs-and-research/undergraduate-research/) outlines research opportunities for MSOE students including our undergraduate research program in which you work with a faculty member on a project over the course of a year and REUs, which are (usually) summer research experiences sponsored by the National Science Foundation that you can pursue at a variety of universities throughout the US. [This website](https://pathwaystoscience.org/) lists several REU and other opportunities. You can also [search for REU opportunities at the NSF&rsquo;s website](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp).
