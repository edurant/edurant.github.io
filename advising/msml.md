title: "Master of Science in Machine Learning"

This is a new degree offering by MSOE beginning in the fall of 2023, coinciding with MSOE's transition to a semester system. It consists of 8, 4-credit courses.

The program and course information for the 2023-2024 graduate catalog (plus the undergraduate catalog) were approved early in 2022 and will be published by MSOE in early January, 2023.

* Dual Enrollment with Bachelor's Degree
  * The MS can be taken as a 5-year dual enrollment program with many MSOE undergraduate degrees including all EECS undergraduate degrees: BME, CE, CS, EE, and SE.
  * The likely tracks for CS and EE will require one summer course before (EE) or after (CS) year 4.
  * CE, CS, EE, and SE majors should be able to add the MS as late as their 4th year, but acting sooner when possible is recommended.
  * BMEs generally need to act earlier. BMEs entering in F23 or later should elect the "AI Focus" option and then can generally elect adding the MS as late as fall of the 4th year.
  * BMEs entering before F23 probably need to decide to pursue the MS by the start of year 3 in order to fit the required classes into 5 years.
  * Typically 2 or 3 of the 5000-level MS ML courses can also meet BS program or free elective requirements at the discretion of the BS program.
  * As of October, 2022, MSOE is working internally to determine enrollment and scholarship rules for dual enrollment students.
* Direct Admit to MS ML requirements (also apply to Graduate Certificate in Applied Machine Learning):
  * Technical bachelor's degree
  * Programming experience with an object-oriented language. One year of college coursework (culminating in e.g., CS2852, CSC1120, or Undergraduate AI Tools) or equivalent minimum.
    * Students with only one semester equivalent (similar to CS1021, CSC1110, or CSC1310) will be required to take CSC5120 Software Development for Machine Learning in one of the MS ML elective slots.
  * At least a year of differential and integral calculus required. Multivariable calculus or linear algebra preferred.
    * Students who don't have both topics will take MTH5810 Mathematical Methods for Machine Learning in one of the MS ML elective slots.

As of October, 2022, EECS has a tentative plan of which classes will run in which semesters, but this is subject to change. The goal is to support the 5-year BS+MS combinations listed above plus 3-semester, 2-year, and 4-year options for direct admit MS ML students.

More information will be posted soon. Please contact MS ML program director [Dr. Durant](/) with any questions.
