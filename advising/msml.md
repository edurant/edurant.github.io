# Overview

This is a new degree offering beginning in the fall of 2023, coinciding with MSOE's transition to a semester system. It consists of 8, 4-credit courses.

All courses will be offered online (fully virtual or in classroom with technology enabling remote participation). Many courses will be synchronous. The 4 classes that are part of graduate certificates (see track below) will be offered in the evening.

Students who were in the 2021–22 cohort of our applied ML graduate certificate, upon which the core classes in the MSML are based, were generally working full-time and said that it was better for them to take 1 course at a time instead of 2. So, for the master's degree, that would translate to 3+ years depending on how many summer classes are taken. The program could be done in 2 years or a bit less if someone took 2 courses at a time.

We expect that many of the students in the program will have tuition support from their employers. Depending on the company, taking one course at a time might also be the best path from a financial perspective if the employer has annual limits on tuition support.

Note that the MSML program (and our ML graduate certificates) do *not* require letters of recommendation, although they are listed as optional on MSOE's common application. Admission is strictly based on academic background and we personally reach out to applicants as needed to clarify any academic background that may be missing.

Please contact MSML program director [Dr. Durant][Dr. Durant] with any questions.

# Dual Enrollment with Bachelor's Degree
The MS can be taken as a 5-year early entry dual enrollment program with many MSOE undergraduate degrees including all EECS undergraduate degrees: BME, CE, CS, EE, and SE. Students [must apply][MSML early entry application] while they have junior standing, but should let their advisor know of their intent as early as possible.

* One or more summer courses are usually required.
* BMEs entering in F23 or later should choose the “AI Focus” option.
* All EECS undergraduate majors allow their free and program elective requirements to be met by MSML courses. Check with your advisor if not in EECS.
  * MSOE allows a maximum of 16 credits of graduate courses (i.e., 4 MSML courses) to be taken before the BS degree is confered.
  * MSML courses *meeting an undergraduate requirement* count toward full-time undergraduate enrollment.
  * Normal undergraduate tuition applies prior to completing the undergraduate degree requirements.
* Juniors: [apply here][MSML early entry application]

## Advising

As each student enters the program, the program director prepares a draft advising plan of which semester the student will take each course. Please contact the program director if you need a copy of your plan, and to make changes, such as increasing or decreasing how many classes you plan to take each semseter.

## [4+1 Model Tracks—Early Entry](https://csse.msoe.us/mlms/)

Model tracks are published for BME, CE, CS, EE, and SE.

## Grade Replacement

MSOE's machine learning programs automatically grant requests to retake and grade replace classes. This means that students in machine learning programs may re-enroll in a class without explicit permission. It also means that, if a grade below a B was earned the first time, the second grade can replace the original grade in GPA calculations. To take advantage of this option, students must notify their program director or coordinator. They will forward the request to the registrar's office, which will then process the replacement at the end of the term. This must be done between week 2 and the week before exam week, preferably early in the term.

# Notes on Specific Courses

## Quarter System Applied ML Graduate Certificate (2021–'22 and 2022–'23)

Completing this certificate at MSOE meets the [CSC5610][CSC5610] and [CSC6621][CSC6621] requirements by substitution, reducing the number of additional courses needed to earn the MSML.

## [CSC5201 Microservices &amp; Cloud Computing][CSC5201]

### Substitutions Allowed: Graduate Courses

There are opportunities to substitute certain courses for the CSC5201 requirement in the MSML and in the ML Engineering Graduate Certificate. [CSC5201][CSC5201], [CSC6711][CSC6711], or CSC6712 can satisfy the CSC5201 requirement. If MSML students take more than 1 of these classes, the additional courses are counted as MSML electives.

### Substitutions Allowed: Undergraduate Courses
Students with sufficient coursework in *both* web apps and cloud computing replace this course with an approved elective.

#### Acceptable Web Apps Coursework
* SE2840 Web Application Development, Required for CS and SE
* [SWE2511 Web Apps][SWE2511], Required for SWE

#### Acceptable Cloud Computing Coursework
* CS4230 / CSC4981 Distributed and Cloud Computing, Elective

Note: SWE2410 Design and Cloud Patterns is *not* sufficient to meet this requirement.

## [CSC5601 Theory of Machine Learning][CSC5601]: CS Major and MSML Elective
Early entry CS majors have the option of taking this course to simultaneously satisfy their undergraduate requirement of CS3400 or [CSC4601][CSC4601]. Students who have credit for CS3400 or [CSC4601][CSC4601] may not take [CSC5601][CSC5601].

## [CSC6605 Machine Learning Production Systems][CSC6605]: Alternate Prerequisites

Although [CSC5201][CSC5201] is *not* a prerequisite for this class, students will benefit from having CSC5201 first whenever possible.

[CSC2621 Introduction to Data Science][CSC2621] (a course in the DS minor) is a sufficient prerequisite to take this course.

Also, CS and SE students will generally meet the following alternate prerequisites by the time they have early entry status.

Requirement      | Quarter | Semester
---              | ---     | ---
(Databases and   | CS3860  | [CSC3320][CSC3320]
Web Apps) or     | SE2840  | [SWE2511][SWE2511]
Machine Learning | CS3400  | [CSC4601][CSC4601]

## [CSC7901 Machine Learning Capstone][CSC7901]

The steps for enrolling in the capstone project course are:
1. Get approval from the program director to begin your capstone in a particular semester.
1. Find a capstone advisor and discuss and refine your project idea.
1. Work with your capstone advisor to identify 2 other MSOE faculty members to serve on your committee. Outside committee members (e.g., the chief data scientist at your company) are allowed via adjunct appointments if they have appropriate experience and background, including at a minimum a relevant master's degree.
1. Complete the [form](https://msoe.s3.amazonaws.com/files/resources/msml-capstone-request-form-eecs-semesters-fillable.pdf) posted on the [Registrar's website](https://www.msoe.edu/academics/departments/registrar/independent-study-forms/), get required signatures, and submit it. Then the class is added to your schedule for the next semester.

Capstone students may work individually, as part of a loosely affiliated group (e.g., regular lab meetings with advisor(s) to get feedback on work in progress), or as a team of two on a large project with clearly defined individual goals. Regardless, each student must submit their own capstone request form.

The following faculty are *some* of the potential capstone project advisors. Feel free to contact them to see if your areas of interest align with their expertise.
* [Dr. Berisha][Dr. Berisha]: Machine/deep learning, image processing, time-series data analysis. In general, my research centers around the application of machine learning algorithms in the fields of biomedicine and remote sensing. My most recent efforts have concentrated on two significant applications. Firstly, I have been exploring the integration of deep learning with hyperspectral mid-infrared imaging to enhance cancer diagnosis. Secondly, my research is dedicated to the application of deep learning techniques in the analysis of ECG data for the diagnosis of cardiovascular, brain injury, and respiratory diseases.
* [Dr. Durant][Dr. Durant]: Signal processing, real-time systems, audio
* [Dr. Kedziora][Dr. Kedziora]: Data science, statistics, machine learning, reinforcement learning
* [Dr. Magaña][Dr. Magaña]: Software Development, Software Process, Databases, Video Game Development. I’m interested in serving as a committee member on capstone projects, particularly when those projects involve aspects of software development or database integration.
* [Dr. Nowling][Dr. Nowling]: Data science, ML and data-intensive systems (production, recommendation, distributed, etc.)
* [Dr. Urbain][Dr. Urbain]: Natural language processing, medical image processing, graph machine learning

## [PHL6001][PHL6001]

For MSOE undergraduates, this class cannot meet the undergraduate ethics requirement, and the undergraduate ethics requirement cannot meet this MSML requirement.

Many undergraduate majors allow a choice of ethics class. Students in these majors, if intending to pursue the MSML, should consider taking [PHL3101 Ethics for Professional Managers and Engineers][PHL3101] or [PHL3103 Bioethics][PHL3103], which have almost no overlap with [PHL6001][PHL6001]. They may also take [PHL3102 Ethics of Digital Technologies and AI][PHL3102], which has a partial overlap with [PHL6001][PHL6001].
