# Overview

This is a new degree offering beginning in the fall of 2023, coinciding with MSOE's transition to a semester system. It consists of 8, 4-credit courses.

All courses will be offered online (fully virtual or in classroom with technology enabling remote participation). Many courses will be synchronous. The 4 classes that are part of graduate certificates (see track below) will be offered in the evening.

Students who were in the 2021–22 cohort of our applied ML graduate certificate, upon which the core classes in the MSML are based, were generally working full-time and said that it was better for them to take 1 course at a time instead of 2. So, for the master's degree, that would translate to 3+ years depending on how many summer classes are taken. The program could be done in 2 years or a bit less if someone took 2 courses at a time.

We expect that many of the students in the program will have tuition support from their employers. Depending on the company, taking one course at a time might also be the best path from a financial perspective if the employer has annual limits on tuition support.

Note that the MSML program (and our ML graduate certificates) do *not* require letters of recommendation, although they are listed as optional on MSOE's common application. Admission is strictly based on academic background and we personally reach out to applicants as needed to clarify any academic background that may be missing.

Please contact MSML program director [Dr. Durant](/) with any questions.

# Dual Enrollment with Bachelor's Degree
The MS can be taken as a 5-year early entry dual enrollment program with many MSOE undergraduate degrees including all EECS undergraduate degrees: BME, CPE, CS, EE, and SE. Students must apply while they have junior standing (or ASAP for students who had senior standing when this policy was announced), but should let their advisor know of their intent as early as possible.

* One or more summer courses are usually required.
* BMEs entering in F23 or later should choose the “AI Focus” option.
* All EECS undergraduate majors allow their free and program elective requirements to be met by MSML courses. Check with your advisor if not in EECS.
  * MSOE allows a maximum of 16 credits of graduate courses (i.e., 4 MSML courses) to be taken before the BS degree is confered.
  * MSML courses *meeting an undergraduate requirement* count toward full-time undergraduate enrollment.
  * Normal undergraduate tuition applies prior to completing the undergraduate degree requirements.

## Direct Admit to MSML requirements (Graduate Certificate in Applied Machine Learning)

* Technical bachelor's degree
* Programming experience with a modern language such as Python, C#, or Java. One year of college coursework (culminating in e.g., CS2852, CSC1120, or CSC2611) or equivalent minimum.
  * Students with less experience (similar to CS1021, CSC1110, or CSC1310) will be encouraged to take CSC5120 Software Development for Machine Learning over the summer. This can count as an elective in the Master of Science in Machine Learning.
* At least a year of differential and integral calculus required. Multivariable calculus or linear algebra preferred.
  * Students who don't have both topics will take MTH5810 Mathematical Methods for Machine Learning in one of the MSML elective slots.

MSOE CS students and graduates replace CSC5610 and MTH5810 with approved electives.

## [4+1 Model Tracks—Early Entry](https://csse.msoe.us/mlms/)

Model tracks are published for BME, CPE, CS, EE, and SE.

# CSC5201 Microservices & Cloud Computing
Students with coursework in *both* web apps and cloud computing replace this course with an approved elective.

## Acceptable Web Apps Coursework
* SE2840 Web Application Development, Required for CS and SE
* SWE2511 Web Apps, Required for SWE

## Acceptable Cloud Computing Coursework
* SWE2410 Design and Cloud Patterns, Required for CSC and SWE
* CS4230 / CSC4981 Distributed and Cloud Computing, Elective

# Alternate CSC6605 Prerequisites

CSC2621 Introduction to Data Science (a course in the DS minor) is a sufficient prerequisite to take this course.

Generally, CSC and SWE students will meet these requirements by the time they have early entry status.
