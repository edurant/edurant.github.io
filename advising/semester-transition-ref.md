Elective labels tagged with NONE are electives your advisor removed from the term as they balanced your course work.

# Common Freshman Variations

## F22 Freshmen Starting in MA120

In 2022, freshmen who start the math sequence in MA120 in fall will take MA120-MA136-MA137 on quarters. In fall of 2023 they will take MTH2980T, a special transition course.

## CS1011 Not Finished In F22

For students who don't take or pass CS1011 in fall, 2022, there are two options:
* Take CS1011/1021/2852 in winter/spring/summer. Summer classes are usually not covered by scholarships; check with financial aid for details.
* Take CS1011/1021/CSC1120 in winter/spring/fall.

# Planned Offerings

## Summer

* Business: None
* EECS: CS2852, may add more
* Math
  * MA 137, MA 2314, MA 2323, MA 235, MA 262, MA 330, MA 383
  * MA 2980: Topics in Mathematics (2 quarter credits). This course covers CALCULUS I (MTH 1110) material that was not included in MA 136. Upon successful completion of this course, a student can take MTH 1120.

## BA3411 in Spring

BA3411 (off track) will run in spring, 2023 in addition to BA3423 (on track). These courses or their semester versions (BUS2411 and BUS3420) are required for all CEs regardless of curriculum version.

## Circuits

Please note that EE2050 alone will not "count" for the first circuits course, ELE2001 in the semester system. EECS will be offering a special topics course EE2980 as a 2-2-3 in Spring as an "add-on" to EE2050 to provide equivalent credit for ELE2001.

### Winter Offerings

* EE2050. Registration will at first be limited to EE students as this is on their transition track.
* EE2060. Registration will at first be limited to CE students as this is on their track. Note that EE2050+EE2060 will count for ELE2001 in the semester system. Those not taking EE2060 this term will still have the chance to take EE2980 next term for the ELE2001 equivalent.
* EE2070. Registration will at first be limited to BME and EE students as this is on their track. Note that completion of EE2070 is required for students to receive equivalent credit for both ELE2001 and ELE2011.

### Spring Offerings

* EE2980. This 2-2-3 course will cover the remainder of the ELE2001 material beyond what is covered in EE2050. Registration will at first be limited to EE students as this is on their transition track. The course will be taught with MA137 as a strict co-req.
* EE2070. Registration will at first be limited to CE students as this is on their track.

### Some implications

* Students will not be able to begin circuits in Spring. These students will need to wait until fall to take ELE2001 Circuits 1, which has a co-requisite of MTH1110 Calculus I.
* Math co-reqs will be strictly enforced. Students with grades of F* in previous courses (MA120 F* for EE2050, MA136 F* or EE2050 F* for EE2980) will not be allowed to continue.

# Semester Academic Catalog

The updated academic catalog for 2023-24 will be published in January, 2023. Until it is published, you may need to check with your advisor with for certain questions (e.g., what are the exact prerequisites of new semester course) that you would normally look to the catalog for.

# Minors

MSOE and the EECS Department in particular are adding new minors with the switch to semesters. These include the following. Full information will be available when the updated academic catalog is published in January, 2023.

## Data Science Minor

(Not available to CS majors.)

For CEs (and other majors that have a year of required software design courses), this minor consists of:

* CSC2611 AI Tools (fall only, 3 credits)
* CSC2621 Intro to Data Science (every spring, plus fall of 2023, 3 credits)
* CSC4801 DS Practicum (spring only, 3 credits)

These courses must be taken in order, plus CSC4801 has a prerequisite of a statistics course such as MA262 or MTH2480. A practicum is an applied project course.

These classes meet CE program/technical (and free) elective requirements.

## Electrical Engineering Minor

(Not available to EE majors.)

CEs are already required to take many courses in the EE minor. To earn the minor, CEs follow the rule that they must take at least 6 credits not specifically required for their major. Note that these courses *can* be used to meet the CE program or free elective requirements.

COURSE | TITLE | SEMESTER CREDITS | NOTES
-- | -- | -- | --
ELE3111 | Electronics II | 3
ELE3201 | Electromagnetic Fields | 3
ELE3211 | Electromagnetic Waves and T-lines | 2
ELE3310 | Introduction to Probability and Random Processes | 3 | Need to confirm that this can be taken by majors like CE for whom MTH2480 is required.
ELE3401 | Electric Power and Machines | 4
ELE3510 | Digital Systems | 4 | Need to determine whether this course will be allowed for CEs.
ELE3701 | Control Systems | 4

## Computer Engineering Minor

(Not available to CE majors.)

## Math Minor

This applies to 2022 freshmen and to most 2022 sophomores. Students further along in the curriculum should consult with their advisor if they will not complete the minor on the quarter system.

Distilling the new, semester-based, math minor requirements relative to the CE major requirements, CEs need to take 2 additional math classes to earn the math minor, which may be 0, 1, or 2 additional classes in total beyond their CE major requirements:

1. Fulfills CE free elective: MTH2130 Calculus III (3rd semester calculus) for 4 credits
1. For students *entering* on the semester system, fulfills MSOE General Education 6d elective: A 3000- or 4000- level class from an approved list. More options may be added. All of these have 3 credits and the prerequisites are from among CE-required classes or MTH2130 Calculus III:
   * MTH3340 Abstract Algebra with Applications
   * MTH3410 Applied Regression Analysis
   * MTH4130 Complex Analysis
   * MTH4150 Partial Differential Equations

The General Education 6d requirement applies to students who *enter* on the semester system. Students entering before the conversion (including freshmen in 2022-23) do not have a 6d elective and instead have humanities and social science credit counts that their advisors are ensuring are met on their transition plans.
