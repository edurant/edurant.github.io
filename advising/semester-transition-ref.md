# Special Elective Codes on Transition Plans

* ELC Free – Free Elective
* ELC HU – Humanities Course (Art History, Fine Arts, German, History, Literature, Philosophy, Spanish)
* ELC HUSS – Humanities or Social Science Course
* ELC PROG – Technical Computer Engineering Program Elective
* ELC SS – Social Science Course (Anthropology, Economics, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology)
* PLC HU – Placeholder for an HU course: This is an administrative tool we use to replicate ELC HU.
* PLC PROG – Placeholder for CPE Elective course: This is an administrative tool we use to replicate ELC PROG.
* PLC SS – Placeholder for an SS course: This is an administrative tool we use to replicate ELC SS.

Elective labels tagged with NONE are electives your advisor removed from the term as they balanced your course work.

# Common Freshman Variations

## Partial Calculus Completion in 2022–'23

### Students With Credit for MA 136
* OPTION 1: Take the bridge course MA 2980T “Bridge to Calculus II” over the summer. This course serves as a prerequisite for 1120. Take MTH 1120 in the fall.
* OPTION 2: Take MA 137 over the summer. Take MTH 2980T “Quarter Calculus III” or MTH 2980U “Quarter Calculus III and IV” in the fall.
* OPTION 3: Take MA 137 during summer subterm 2 (early part of summer). Take MA 2314 during summer subterm 3 (late part of summer).
* OPTION 4: Take MTH 1110 in the fall.

Transferring a course from another institution is challenging in this case.

### Students With Credit for MA 137
* OPTION 1: Take MA 2314 over the summer.
* OPTION 2: Take MTH 2980T “Quarter Calculus III” or MTH 2980U “Quarter Calculus III and IV” in the fall.
* OPTION 3: Take Semester Calculus II at a different university over the summer and transfer it to MSOE as MA 2314.

# Planned Offerings

## Summer

* Business: None
* EECS: CS2852, may add more
* Math
  * MA 137, MA 2314, MA 2323, MA 235, MA 262, MA 330, MA 383
  * MA 2980: Topics in Mathematics (2 quarter credits). This course covers CALCULUS I (MTH 1110) material that was not included in MA 136. Upon successful completion of this course, a student can take MTH 1120.

# Minors

MSOE and the EECS Department in particular are adding new minors with the switch to semesters. These include the following. Full information will be available when the updated academic catalog is published in January, 2023.

## [Data Science Minor](https://catalog.msoe.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=31&poid=1729)

(Not available to CS majors.)

For CPEs (and other majors that have a year of required software design courses), this minor consists of:

* CSC2611 AI Tools (fall only, 3 credits)
* CSC2621 Intro to Data Science (every spring, plus fall of 2023, 3 credits)
* CSC4801 DS Practicum (spring only, 3 credits)

These courses must be taken in order, plus CSC4801 has a prerequisite of a statistics course such as MA262 or MTH2480. A practicum is an applied project course.

These classes meet CPE program/technical (and free) elective requirements.

## [Electrical Engineering Minor](https://catalog.msoe.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=31&poid=1737)

(Not available to EE majors.)

CPEs are already required to take many courses in the EE minor. To earn the minor, CPEs follow the rule that they must take at least 6 credits not specifically required for their major. Note that these courses *can* be used to meet the CPE program or free elective requirements.

## [Computer Engineering Minor](https://catalog.msoe.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=31&poid=1730)

(Not available to CPE majors.)

## Math Minor

This applies to 2022 freshmen and to most 2022 sophomores. Students further along in the curriculum should consult with their advisor if they will not complete the minor on the quarter system.

Distilling the new, semester-based, math minor requirements relative to the CPE major requirements, CPEs need to take 2 additional math classes to earn the math minor, which may be 0, 1, or 2 additional classes in total beyond their CPE major requirements:

1. Fulfills CPE free elective: MTH2130 Calculus III (3rd semester calculus) for 4 credits
1. For students *entering* on the semester system, fulfills MSOE General Education 6d elective: A 3000- or 4000- level class from an approved list. More options may be added. All of these have 3 credits and the prerequisites are from among CPE-required classes or MTH2130 Calculus III:
   * MTH3340 Abstract Algebra with Applications
   * MTH3410 Applied Regression Analysis
   * MTH4130 Complex Analysis
   * MTH4150 Partial Differential Equations

The General Education 6d requirement applies to students who *enter* on the semester system. Students entering before the conversion (including freshmen in 2022-23) do not have a 6d elective and instead have humanities and social science credit counts that their advisors are ensuring are met on their transition plans.
